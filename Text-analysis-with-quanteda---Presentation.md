## What is quanteda?

quanteda is an R package to perform a variety of natural language processing tasks: corpus management, tokenization, analysis, visualization.

→ *quanteda is to text analysis what dplyr and tidyr are to data wrangling*

In quanteda, text is processed as:

- corpus → after having converted text data in corpus format (through the corpus function) we can work on it with quanteda; a corpus holds documents separately from each other.

- tokens → usually each word in a text, but also single characters or sentences if we want

- document-feature matrix (“dfm”) → the analytical unit in which perform analysis; text documents are organized in matrices, with original texts as rows and features as columns. “Features” are more generally defined than “terms”, as they may be raw terms, stemmed terms, terms without stopwords, etc.

## Why use quanteda?

quanteda is built to be faster and more efficient than any other R or Python package for processing large textual data. Infrastructure on three main pillars:

- stringi package for text processing

- Matrix package for sparse matrix objects

- computationally intensive processing (e.g. for tokens) handled in parallelized C++

**Intuitive, powerful, and flexible**

Her mother had died\\ntoo long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of\\nher caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as\\ngoverness, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\\n\\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a\\ngoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\\nof Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before\\nMiss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the\\nmildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint;\\nand the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been\\nliving together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma\\ndoing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but\\ndirected chiefly by her own.\\n\\nThe real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\\nwell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\\nher many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived,\\nthat they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.\\n\\nSorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\\ndisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's\\nloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this\\nbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\\ncontinuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and\\nherself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer\\na long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as\\nusual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.\\n\\nThe event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\\npleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\\nwith what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\\npromoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The want\\nof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\\npast kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how she had\\ntaught and how she had played with her from five years old--how she had\\ndevoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health--and how\\nnursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\\ngratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven\\nyears, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\\nIsabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\\ndearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\\nas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\\nall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\\npeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\\nhers--one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\\nsuch an affection for her as could never find fault.\\n\\nHow was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was going\\nonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\\ndifference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss\\nTaylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic,\\nshe was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She\\ndearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not\\nmeet her in conversation, rational or playful.\\n\\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of\\nmind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\\neverywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\\ntemper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\\n\\nHer sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\\nsettled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\\nreach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\\nthrough at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\\nIsabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\\nand give her pleasant society again.\\n\\nHighbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\\nname, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses\\nwere first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\\nacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\\nnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even\\nhalf a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over\\nit, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it\\nnecessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous\\nman, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and\\nhating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the\\norigin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet\\nreconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her\\nbut with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\\nwhen he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his\\nhabits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that\\nother people could feel differently from himself, he was very much\\ndisposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for\\nthem, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the\\nrest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully\\nas she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was\\nimpossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\\n\\n\"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\\nMr. Weston ever thought of her!\"\\n\\n\"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such\\na good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\\na good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for\\never, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\\nown?\"\\n\\n\"A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\\nThis is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours, my\\ndear.\"\\n\\n\"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--We\\nshall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\\nvisit very soon.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\\nnot walk half so far.\"\\n\\n\"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\\nto be sure.\"\\n\\n\"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\\nlittle way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\\nvisit?\"\\n\\n\"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we have\\nsettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\\nnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\\nto Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I only\\ndoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\\npapa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\\nmentioned her--James is so obliged to you!\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\\nhave had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\\nsure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken\\ngirl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\\ncurtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\\nhave had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\\nof the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\\nexcellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\\nto have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\\nover to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will\\nbe able to tell her how we all are.\"\\n\\nEmma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\\nhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\\nthrough the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\\nbackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked\\nin and made it unnecessary.\\n\\nMr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He lived\\nabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\\nand at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\\nmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\\nsome days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\\nwell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated\\nMr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\\nalways did him good; and his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and\\nher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\\nWoodhouse gratefully observed, \"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\\nto come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have\\nhad a shocking walk.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\\nmust draw back from your great fire.\"\\n\\n\"But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\\ncatch cold.\"\\n\\n\"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.\"\\n\\n\"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\\nhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\\nbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"\\n\\n\"By the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\\nsort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\\ncongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\\nall behave? Who cried most?\"\\n\\n\"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\\n'poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\\ncomes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, it\\nmust be better to have only one to please than two.\"\\n\\n\"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\\ncreature!\" said Emma playfully. \"That is what you have in your head, I\\nknow--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\"\\n\\n\"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse, with a\\nsigh. \"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\\nKnightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\\nmyself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--in a\\njoke--it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\\nin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\\nthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew\\nit would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\\nreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\\nevery body.\\n\\n\"Emma knows I never flatter her,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"but I meant no\\nreflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\\nto please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a\\ngainer.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Emma, willing to let it pass--\"you want to hear about\\nthe wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\\ncharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not\\na tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we\\nwere going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every\\nday.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father. \"But, Mr.\\nKnightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\\nsure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\"\\n\\nEmma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. \"It\\nis impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\" said Mr.\\nKnightley. \"We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\\nsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's\\nadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's\\ntime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\\nher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\\nherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\\nmust be glad to have her so happily married.\"\\n\\n\"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\" said Emma, \"and a very\\nconsiderable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, you\\nknow, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the\\nright, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may\\ncomfort me for any thing.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, \"Ah!\\nmy dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\\nwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\\nmatches.\"\\n\\n\"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\\nother people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\\nsuccess, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\\nagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\\nseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\\neither in his business in town or among his friends here, always\\nacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--Mr. Weston need not spend\\na single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\\nWeston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\\npromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\\nuncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\\nsubject, but I believed none of it.\\n\\n\"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I met\\nwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\\naway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\\nFarmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match\\nfrom that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance,\\ndear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand what you mean by 'success,'\" said Mr. Knightley.\\n\"Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\\nspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\\nabout this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But\\nif, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means\\nonly your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it\\nwould be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry\\nher,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why\\ndo you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You\\nmade a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be said.\"\\n\\n\"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--I\\npity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\\nnever merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my\\npoor word 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\\nentirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\\nbut I think there may be a third--a something between the do-nothing and\\nthe do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given\\nmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\\nnot have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\\nenough to comprehend that.\"\\n\\n\"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\\nown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\\ngood to them, by interference.\"\\n\\n\"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\" rejoined\\nMr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. \"But, my dear, pray do not\\nmake any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's family\\ncircle grievously.\"\\n\\n\"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\\nElton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\\nHighbury who deserves him--and he has been here a whole year, and has\\nfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him\\nsingle any longer--and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day,\\nhe looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office\\ndone for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I\\nhave of doing him a service.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young\\nman, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any\\nattention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will\\nbe a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to\\nmeet him.\"\\n\\n\"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,\" said Mr. Knightley,\\nlaughing, \"and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better\\nthing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish\\nand the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a\\nman of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\\ngentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on\\nsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\\nfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\\nand had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering\\ninto the militia of his county, then embodied.\\n\\nCaptain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\\nmilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire\\nfamily, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized,\\nexcept her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were\\nfull of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.\\n\\nMiss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\\nfortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate--was\\nnot to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the\\ninfinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with\\ndue decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much\\nhappiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a\\nhusband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due\\nto her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;\\nbut though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had\\nresolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother,\\nbut not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's\\nunreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\\nThey lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison\\nof Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at\\nonce to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\\n\\nCaptain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\\nthe bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he\\nwas rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\\nFrom the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy\\nhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\\nmother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\\nChurchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature\\nof equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the\\nlittle Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some reluctance\\nthe widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were\\novercome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and\\nthe wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek,\\nand his own situation to improve as he could.\\n\\nA complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\\nengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\\nLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which\\nbrought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\\nwhere most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation\\nand the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his\\nlife passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easy\\ncompetence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining\\nHighbury, which he had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as\\nportionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of\\nhis own friendly and social disposition.\\n\\nIt was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\\nschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,\\nit had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\\npurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\\nbut he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\\naccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\\nhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\\nprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\\nnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\\neven in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\\na well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\\npleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\\nchosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.\\n\\nHe had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;\\nfor as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\\nuncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\\nthe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore,\\nthat he should ever want his father's assistance. His father had no\\napprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her\\nhusband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that\\nany caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he\\nbelieved, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in London, and\\nwas proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man\\nhad made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was looked on as\\nsufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a\\nkind of common concern.\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\\ncuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\\nreturned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit\\nhis father had been often talked of but never achieved.\\n\\nNow, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a\\nmost proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a\\ndissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with\\nMrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now\\nwas the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope\\nstrengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new\\nmother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury\\nincluded some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.\\n\"I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill\\nhas written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter,\\nindeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and\\nhe says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.\"\\n\\nIt was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,\\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most\\nwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation\\nwhich her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most\\nfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate\\nshe might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial\\nseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and\\nwho could ill bear to part with her.\\n\\nShe knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without\\npain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui,\\nfrom the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble\\ncharacter; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would\\nhave been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped\\nwould bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and\\nprivations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of\\nRandalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking,\\nand in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the\\napproaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in\\nthe week together.\\n\\nHer situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\\nWeston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more\\nthan satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\\nthat Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\\nat his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her\\nat Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\\nin the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her\\nown. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,\\nand saying, \"Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.\"\\n\\nThere was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to\\npity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\\nThe compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\\nbeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\\nhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach\\ncould bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\\ndifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit\\nfor any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them\\nfrom having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\\nearnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at the\\npains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry\\nwas an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\\nof the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he\\ncould not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\\nof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\\nmany--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\\nopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\\nevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\\nand there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.\\n\\nThere was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being\\nseen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.\\nWoodhouse would never believe it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to\\nhave his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from\\nhis long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,\\nhis house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his\\nown little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much\\nintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late\\nhours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but\\nsuch as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him, Highbury,\\nincluding Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish\\nadjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not\\nunfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of the chosen and\\nthe best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred;\\nand, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there\\nwas scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a\\ncard-table for him.\\n\\nReal, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by\\nMr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege\\nof exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the\\nelegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles\\nof his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.\\n\\nAfter these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were\\nMrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at\\nthe service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and\\ncarried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for\\neither James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it\\nwould have been a grievance.\\n\\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\\nsingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\\nregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\\ncircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\\nMiss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\\nmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\\nmake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\\noutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\\nyouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted\\nto the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small\\nincome go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman\\nwhom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal good-will\\nand contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved every body,\\nwas interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's\\nmerits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with\\nblessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours\\nand friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and\\ncheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a\\nrecommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She was\\na great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse,\\nfull of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\\n\\nMrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or an\\nestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,\\nupon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormous\\npay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real,\\nhonest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of\\naccomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might\\nbe sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little\\neducation, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard's\\nschool was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was\\nreckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden,\\ngave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great\\ndeal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own\\nhands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\\nafter her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who\\nhad worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the\\noccasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr.\\nWoodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat\\nparlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose\\na few sixpences by his fireside.\\n\\nThese were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to\\ncollect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power; though,\\nas far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of\\nMrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and\\nvery much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the\\nquiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so\\nspent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.\\n\\nAs she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the\\npresent day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most\\nrespectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most\\nwelcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew\\nvery well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of\\nher beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no\\nlonger dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\\n\\nHarriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed\\nher, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody\\nhad lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of\\nparlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.\\nShe had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and\\nwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young\\nladies who had been at school there with her.\\n\\nShe was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\\nwhich Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a\\nfine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great\\nsweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased\\nwith her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the\\nacquaintance.\\n\\nShe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's\\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed\\nby the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had\\nbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\\nEncouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those\\nnatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury\\nand its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed were\\nunworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though very\\ngood sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of the\\nname of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large\\nfarm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very\\ncreditably, she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of\\nthem--but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the\\nintimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance\\nto be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve her; she\\nwould detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good\\nsociety; she would form her opinions and her manners. It would be an\\ninteresting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her\\nown situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\\n\\nShe was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and\\nlistening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the\\nevening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which\\nalways closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and\\nwatch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the\\nfire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse\\nof a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every\\nthing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted\\nwith its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and\\nhelp and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an\\nurgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil\\nscruples of their guests.\\n\\nUpon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare.\\nHe loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his\\nyouth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him\\nrather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would\\nhave welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health\\nmade him grieve that they would eat.\\n\\nSuch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could,\\nwith thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain\\nhimself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to\\nsay:\\n\\n\"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg\\nboiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg\\nbetter than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body\\nelse; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see--one of\\nour small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a\\n_little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You\\nneed not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the\\ncustard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A\\n_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could\\ndisagree with you.\"\\n\\nEmma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a much\\nmore satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular\\npleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was\\nquite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage\\nin Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much\\npanic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with\\nhighly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss\\nWoodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken hands\\nwith her at last!\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nHarriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick\\nand decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and\\ntelling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so\\ndid their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had\\nvery early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect\\nMrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never went beyond the\\nshrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long\\nwalk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage\\nher exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to\\nRandalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore,\\none whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable\\naddition to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more of\\nher, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.\\n\\nHarriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\\ndisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\\nguided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself\\nwas very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\\nappreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no\\nwant of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\\nAltogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the\\nyoung friend she wanted--exactly the something which her home required.\\nSuch a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\\nnever be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\\nsort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the\\nobject of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet\\nwould be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there\\nwas nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.\\n\\nHer first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\\nwere the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell\\nevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma\\nwas obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in\\nthe same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet\\nhad no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what\\nMrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.\\n\\nMrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of\\nthe school in general, formed naturally a great part of the\\nconversation--and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of\\nAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied\\nher thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,\\nand now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her\\ntalkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,\\nand enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\\nexultation of Mrs. Martin's having \"_two_ parlours, two very good\\nparlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's\\ndrawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived\\nfive-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of\\nthem Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch\\ncow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it,\\nit should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome\\nsummer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to\\ndrink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen\\npeople.\"\\n\\nFor some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate\\ncause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings\\narose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and\\ndaughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it\\nappeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was\\nalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing\\nsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.\\nMartin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were not\\ntaken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\\n\\nWith this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and\\nmeaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\\nand there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to\\nspeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening\\ngames; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and\\nobliging. He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her\\nsome walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in\\nevery thing else he was so very obliging. He had his shepherd's son into\\nthe parlour one night on purpose to sing to her. She was very fond\\nof singing. He could sing a little himself. She believed he was very\\nclever, and understood every thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while\\nshe was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body in\\nthe country. She believed every body spoke well of him. His mother and\\nsisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and\\nthere was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body\\nto be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he\\nwould make a good husband. Not that she _wanted_ him to marry. She was\\nin no hurry at all.\\n\\n\"Well done, Mrs. Martin!\" thought Emma. \"You know what you are about.\"\\n\\n\"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever\\nseen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\\nteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\\nher.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\\nhis own business? He does not read?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has read a\\ngood deal--but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window\\nseats--but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an evening,\\nbefore we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of the\\nElegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the Vicar of\\nWakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of\\nthe Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but\\nhe is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can.\"\\n\\nThe next question was--\\n\\n\"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\\nafter a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now and\\nthen, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston.\\nHe has passed you very often.\"\\n\\n\"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\\nany idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\\nis the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\\nprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do.\\nA degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me;\\nI might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other. But\\na farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as\\nmuch above my notice as in every other he is below it.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him;\\nbut he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\\nindeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\\nhis age to be?\"\\n\\n\"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\\n23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd.\"\\n\\n\"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they\\nare, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably\\nrepent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young\\nwoman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very\\ndesirable.\"\\n\\n\"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\"\\n\\n\"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not\\nborn to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely\\nto make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he\\nmight come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family\\nproperty, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and\\nso forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in\\ntime, it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing\\nyet.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\\nindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\\nof taking a boy another year.\"\\n\\n\"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\\nmarry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though his\\nsisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\\nto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\\nto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\\ncareful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\\ngentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by\\nevery thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who\\nwould take pleasure in degrading you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,\\nand you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any\\nbody can do.\"\\n\\n\"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would\\nhave you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent\\neven of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently\\nwell connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd\\nacquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still\\nbe in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn\\nin by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife,\\nwho will probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without education.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\\nbut what had had some education--and been very well brought up. However,\\nI do not mean to set up my opinion against yours--and I am sure I shall\\nnot wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great\\nregard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very\\nsorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But\\nif he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not\\nvisit her, if I can help it.\"\\n\\nEmma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no\\nalarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, but\\nshe trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious\\ndifficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her\\nown.\\n\\nThey met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\\nDonwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at\\nher, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\\nnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\\nyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\\nsufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\\nneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\\nother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen,\\nshe thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet's\\ninclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\\nnoticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\\nMartin looked as if he did not know what manner was.\\n\\nThey remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be\\nkept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,\\nand in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to\\ncompose.\\n\\n\"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was quite\\na chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\\nthink we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls\\nmost days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.\\nHe was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it,\\nbut he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well,\\nMiss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think of him?\\nDo you think him so very plain?\"\\n\\n\"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is nothing\\ncompared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\\nmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\\nvery clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\\ndegree or two nearer gentility.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \"he is not so genteel\\nas real gentlemen.\"\\n\\n\"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\\nmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield,\\nyou have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I\\nshould be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company\\nwith Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior\\ncreature--and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him\\nat all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not\\nyou struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and\\nabrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly\\nunmodulated as I stood here.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air and\\nway of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. But\\nMr. Knightley is so very fine a man!\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to\\ncompare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with\\n_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the\\nonly gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston\\nand Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their\\nmanner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent.\\nYou must see the difference.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old\\nman. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.\"\\n\\n\"Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\\ngrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not\\nbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or\\nawkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later\\nage. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.\\nWeston's time of life?\"\\n\\n\"There is no saying, indeed,\" replied Harriet rather solemnly.\\n\\n\"But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,\\nvulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of\\nnothing but profit and loss.\"\\n\\n\"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.\"\\n\\n\"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\\nHe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\\nelse--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to\\ndo with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very\\nrich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb\\n_us_.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder he did not remember the book\"--was all Harriet's answer, and\\nspoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be\\nsafely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her\\nnext beginning was,\\n\\n\"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr.\\nKnightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might be\\nmore safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,\\nalmost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,\\nbecause there is so much good-humour with it--but that would not do to\\nbe copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding\\nsort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,\\nand situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set\\nabout copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think\\na young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a\\nmodel. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.\\nHe seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know\\nwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,\\nHarriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are\\nsofter than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please\\nyou. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?\"\\n\\nShe then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr.\\nElton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and\\nsaid she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\\n\\nMr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young\\nfarmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an excellent\\nmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her\\nto have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body\\nelse must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any\\nbody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had\\nentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming to\\nHartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense\\nof its expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the\\ngentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of\\nany family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\\nHe had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient\\nincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\\nto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him\\nas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any\\ndeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\\n\\nShe had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\\ngirl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was\\nfoundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be little\\ndoubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual\\nweight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a\\nyoung man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned very\\nhandsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,\\nthere being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense\\nwith:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding\\nabout the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by\\nMr. Elton's admiration.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\n\"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr.\\nKnightley, \"of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I\\nthink it a bad thing.\"\\n\\n\"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?\"\\n\\n\"I think they will neither of them do the other any good.\"\\n\\n\"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with a\\nnew object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been\\nseeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently\\nwe feel!--Not think they will do each other any good! This will\\ncertainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.\\nKnightley.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing\\nWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks\\nexactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday,\\nand agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a\\ngirl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not\\nallow you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live\\nalone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no\\nman can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of\\none of her own sex, after being used to it all her life. I can imagine\\nyour objection to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young woman\\nwhich Emma's friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants\\nto see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more\\nherself. They will read together. She means it, I know.\"\\n\\n\"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old.\\nI have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of\\nbooks that she meant to read regularly through--and very good lists\\nthey were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimes\\nalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew\\nup when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\\ncredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\\nout a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of\\nsteady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing\\nrequiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\\nunderstanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\\naffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her\\nto read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say,\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"that I thought so\\n_then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting\\nto do any thing I wished.\"\\n\\n\"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,\"--said\\nMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. \"But I,\"\\nhe soon added, \"who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must\\nstill see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest\\nof her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able to\\nanswer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was always\\nquick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she\\nwas twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her\\nmother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits her\\nmother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her.\"\\n\\n\"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_\\nrecommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another\\nsituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to\\nany body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, smiling. \"You are better placed _here_; very fit for a\\nwife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself to\\nbe an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might\\nnot give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to\\npromise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on the\\nvery material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing\\nas you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I\\nshould certainly have named Miss Taylor.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to\\nsuch a man as Mr. Weston.\"\\n\\n\"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that\\nwith every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We\\nwill not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of\\ncomfort, or his son may plague him.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not _that_.--It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not\\nforetell vexation from that quarter.\"\\n\\n\"Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's\\ngenius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the\\nyoung man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But\\nHarriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\\nvery worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows\\nnothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a\\nflatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.\\nHer ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any\\nthing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful\\ninferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_ cannot\\ngain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit\\nwith all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined\\nenough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances\\nhave placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any\\nstrength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally\\nto the varieties of her situation in life.--They only give a little\\npolish.\"\\n\\n\"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more\\nanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\\nHow well she looked last night!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very\\nwell; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty.\"\\n\\n\"Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect\\nbeauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\\nseen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial\\nold friend.\"\\n\\n\"Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,\\nopen countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\\nand such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\\nThere is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her\\nglance. One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health;'\\nnow, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of\\ngrown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\"\\n\\n\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\" he replied. \"I think her\\nall you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,\\nthat I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome\\nshe is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies\\nanother way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of\\nHarriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.\"\\n\\n\"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not\\ndoing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she is an\\nexcellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder\\nsister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\\ntrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\\nlasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred\\ntimes.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and\\nI will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella.\\nJohn loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection,\\nand Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not quite\\nfrightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their opinions\\nwith me.\"\\n\\n\"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\\nbut excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\\nyou know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's\\nmother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any\\npossible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made a\\nmatter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any\\nlittle inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be\\nexpected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly\\napproves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a\\nsource of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to\\ngive advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little\\nremains of office.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" cried he; \"I am much obliged to you for it. It is very\\ngood advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often\\nfound; for it shall be attended to.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about\\nher sister.\"\\n\\n\"Be satisfied,\" said he, \"I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my\\nill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella\\ndoes not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;\\nperhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one\\nfeels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!\"\\n\\n\"So do I,\" said Mrs. Weston gently, \"very much.\"\\n\\n\"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just\\nnothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she\\ncared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love\\nwith a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some\\ndoubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts\\nto attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.\"\\n\\n\"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution\\nat present,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"as can well be; and while she is so\\nhappy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which\\nwould be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account. I\\ndo not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight\\nto the state, I assure you.\"\\n\\nPart of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own\\nand Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes\\nat Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirable to\\nhave them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon\\nafterwards made to \"What does Weston think of the weather; shall we have\\nrain?\" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about\\nHartfield.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nEmma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a proper\\ndirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good\\npurpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.\\nElton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;\\nand as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his\\nadmiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creating\\nas much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any occasion for.\\nShe was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of\\nfalling in love, if not in love already. She had no scruple with regard\\nto him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could\\nnot suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add. His\\nperception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her\\nintroduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of\\nhis growing attachment.\\n\\n\"You have given Miss Smith all that she required,\" said he; \"you have\\nmade her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she\\ncame to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are\\ninfinitely superior to what she received from nature.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted\\ndrawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the\\nnatural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have\\ndone very little.\"\\n\\n\"If it were admissible to contradict a lady,\" said the gallant Mr.\\nElton--\\n\\n\"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have\\ntaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded\\ndecision of character! Skilful has been the hand!\"\\n\\n\"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition\\nmore truly amiable.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it.\" And it was spoken with a sort of sighing\\nanimation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased\\nanother day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,\\nto have Harriet's picture.\\n\\n\"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?\" said she: \"did you\\never sit for your picture?\"\\n\\nHarriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,\\nwith a very interesting naivete,\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, no, never.\"\\n\\nNo sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,\\n\\n\"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\\ngive any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.\\nYou do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great\\npassion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and\\nwas thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or\\nanother, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture,\\nif Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her\\npicture!\"\\n\\n\"Let me entreat you,\" cried Mr. Elton; \"it would indeed be a delight!\\nLet me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent\\nin favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could\\nyou suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your\\nlandscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable\\nfigure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?\"\\n\\nYes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking\\nlikenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be in raptures\\nabout mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. \"Well, if you give me\\nsuch kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do.\\nHarriet's features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult;\\nand yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines\\nabout the mouth which one ought to catch.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I have\\nnot a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,\\nit will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.\"\\n\\n\"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks\\nso little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of answering\\nme? How completely it meant, 'why should my picture be drawn?'\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still\\nI cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\"\\n\\nHarriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the\\nearnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly,\\nand therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at\\nportraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might\\ndecide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many beginnings were\\ndisplayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and\\nwater-colours had been all tried in turn. She had always wanted to do\\nevery thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than\\nmany might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to.\\nShe played and sang;--and drew in almost every style; but steadiness\\nhad always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree of\\nexcellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not to\\nhave failed of. She was not much deceived as to her own skill either\\nas an artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others\\ndeceived, or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often\\nhigher than it deserved.\\n\\nThere was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the\\nmost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there\\nbeen ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions\\nwould have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A likeness\\npleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.\\n\\n\"No great variety of faces for you,\" said Emma. \"I had only my own\\nfamily to study from. There is my father--another of my father--but the\\nidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only\\ntake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston\\nagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\\nkindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.\\nThere is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!--and\\nthe face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she\\nwould have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw\\nher four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my\\nattempts at three of those four children;--there they are, Henry and\\nJohn and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of\\nthem might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them\\ndrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\\nor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\\nany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\\ncoarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is my\\nsketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\\nthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\\nwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That's very\\nlike. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very\\ngood. Then here is my last,\"--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman\\nin small size, whole-length--\"my last and my best--my brother, Mr. John\\nKnightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I put it away\\nin a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I could not\\nhelp being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made\\na very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in\\nthinking it _very_ like)--only too handsome--too flattering--but\\nthat was a fault on the right side\"--after all this, came poor dear\\nIsabella's cold approbation of--\"Yes, it was a little like--but to be\\nsure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble\\nin persuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\\naltogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish\\nit, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every\\nmorning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then\\nforswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet's sake, or rather\\nfor my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_\\n_present_, I will break my resolution now.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was\\nrepeating, \"No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as\\nyou observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,\" with so interesting a\\nconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\\nleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\\ndeclaration must wait a little longer.\\n\\nShe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be\\na whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and was\\ndestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable station\\nover the mantelpiece.\\n\\nThe sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not\\nkeeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\\nyouthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\\ndoing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\\ntouch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\\nand gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\\nit, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\\nto employ him in reading.\\n\\n\"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen the\\nirksomeness of Miss Smith's.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\\nShe must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less\\nwould certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at the\\nsmallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress,\\nand be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager,\\nfor his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it\\nwas possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and his\\ncomplaisance were unexceptionable.\\n\\nThe sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\\npleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\\nof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\\nto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\\nheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of\\nits being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling\\nits destined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of the\\nbeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both;\\nwith as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising\\nattachment was likely to add.\\n\\nHarriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\\n\\n\"By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the\\nparty.\"\\n\\nThe same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\\ntook place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the\\npicture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,\\nbut Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every\\ncriticism.\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\\nwanted,\"--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting that\\nshe was addressing a lover.--\"The expression of the eye is most correct,\\nbut Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of\\nher face that she has them not.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?\" replied he. \"I cannot agree with you. It appears\\nto me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a\\nlikeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.\"\\n\\n\"You have made her too tall, Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nEmma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly\\nadded,\\n\\n\"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she\\nis sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which in short\\ngives exactly the idea--and the proportions must be preserved, you know.\\nProportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of\\nsuch a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!\"\\n\\n\"It is very pretty,\" said Mr. Woodhouse. \"So prettily done! Just as your\\ndrawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well\\nas you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems\\nto be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her\\nshoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\\nLook at the tree.\"\\n\\n\"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"You, sir, may say any thing,\" cried Mr. Elton, \"but I must confess that\\nI regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of\\ndoors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other\\nsituation would have been much less in character. The naivete of Miss\\nSmith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep\\nmy eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.\"\\n\\nThe next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few\\ndifficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the\\norder must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste\\ncould be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,\\nmust not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse\\ncould not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of\\nDecember. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it\\nwas removed. His gallantry was always on the alert. \"Might he be trusted\\nwith the commission, what infinite pleasure should he have in executing\\nit! he could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how\\nmuch he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.\"\\n\\n\"He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would not give\\nhim such a troublesome office for the world,\"--brought on the desired\\nrepetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few minutes settled\\nthe business.\\n\\nMr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give\\nthe directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its\\nsafety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of\\nnot being incommoded enough.\\n\\n\"What a precious deposit!\" said he with a tender sigh, as he received\\nit.\\n\\n\"This man is almost too gallant to be in love,\" thought Emma. \"I should\\nsay so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of\\nbeing in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\\nexactly; it will be an 'Exactly so,' as he says himself; but he does\\nsigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\\nendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.\\nBut it is his gratitude on Harriet's account.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nThe very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion\\nfor Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,\\nas usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to\\nreturn again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been\\ntalked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\\nextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a\\nminute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to\\nMrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and\\nfinding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a\\nlittle parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\\nopening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which\\nshe had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was\\nfrom him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage.\\n\"Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did not know what\\nto do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter,\\nat least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her very\\nmuch--but she did not know--and so, she was come as fast as she could to\\nask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.--\" Emma was half-ashamed of her\\nfriend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" she cried, \"the young man is determined not to lose any\\nthing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.\"\\n\\n\"Will you read the letter?\" cried Harriet. \"Pray do. I'd rather you\\nwould.\"\\n\\nEmma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The style\\nof the letter was much above her expectation. There were not merely no\\ngrammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a\\ngentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and\\nthe sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It was\\nshort, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety,\\neven delicacy of feeling. She paused over it, while Harriet stood\\nanxiously watching for her opinion, with a \"Well, well,\" and was at last\\nforced to add, \"Is it a good letter? or is it too short?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, a very good letter,\" replied Emma rather slowly--\"so\\ngood a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his\\nsisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom\\nI saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\\nleft quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;\\nno, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a\\nwoman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural\\ntalent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and when he takes a pen in\\nhand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men.\\nYes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments\\nto a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet\\n(returning it,) than I had expected.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the still waiting Harriet;--\"well--and--and what shall I\\ndo?\"\\n\\n\"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this\\nletter?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and\\nspeedily.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express\\nyourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not\\nbeing intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be\\nunequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude\\nand concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\\npresent themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need\\nnot be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his\\ndisappointment.\"\\n\\n\"You think I ought to refuse him then,\" said Harriet, looking down.\\n\\n\"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\\ndoubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\\nunder a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel\\nin doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you were\\nconsulting me only as to the wording of it.\"\\n\\nHarriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\\n\\n\"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would you\\nadvise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do\\nwith it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.\"\\n\\n\"I had no notion that he liked me so very much,\" said Harriet,\\ncontemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her\\nsilence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that\\nletter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\\n\\n\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as\\nto whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse\\nhim. If she can hesitate as to 'Yes,' she ought to say 'No' directly.\\nIt is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with\\nhalf a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older than yourself,\\nto say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to influence\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you would\\njust advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--As\\nyou say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should not be\\nhesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say 'No,'\\nperhaps.--Do you think I had better say 'No?'\"\\n\\n\"Not for the world,\" said Emma, smiling graciously, \"would I advise you\\neither way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you\\nprefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most\\nagreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you\\nhesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at\\nthis moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive\\nyourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this\\nmoment whom are you thinking of?\"\\n\\nThe symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned away\\nconfused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was\\nstill in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard.\\nEmma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong hopes. At\\nlast, with some hesitation, Harriet said--\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well\\nas I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost\\nmade up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\\nwhat you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to\\nmyself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation\\nin approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would\\nhave grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the\\nconsequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest\\ndegree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence;\\nbut it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could not have\\nvisited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you\\nfor ever.\"\\n\\nHarriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her\\nforcibly.\\n\\n\"You could not have visited me!\" she cried, looking aghast. \"No, to be\\nsure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have\\nbeen too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not\\ngive up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing\\nin the world.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it\\nmust have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.\\nI must have given you up.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me\\nnever to come to Hartfield any more!\"\\n\\n\"Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_\\nconfined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I\\nwonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must\\nhave a pretty good opinion of himself.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think he is conceited either, in general,\" said Harriet, her\\nconscience opposing such censure; \"at least, he is very good natured,\\nand I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\\nfor--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know, though\\nhe may like me, it does not follow that I should--and certainly I must\\nconfess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and if one comes\\nto compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,\\n_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.\\nMartin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and\\nhis being so much attached to me--and his writing such a letter--but as\\nto leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be\\nparted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\\nbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.\"\\n\\nEmma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a \"very\\ntrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\\nmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\\nher husband could write a good letter.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\\nhappy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him. But\\nhow shall I do? What shall I say?\"\\n\\nEmma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised\\nits being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her\\nassistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance\\nbeing wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence.\\nThe looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had such a\\nsoftening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace her up\\nwith a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much concerned at\\nthe idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of what his mother\\nand sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that they should not\\nfancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man had come in\\nher way at that moment, he would have been accepted after all.\\n\\nThis letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business\\nwas finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but\\nEmma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by\\nspeaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of\\nMr. Elton.\\n\\n\"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,\" was said in rather a\\nsorrowful tone.\\n\\n\"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You\\nare a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but\\nat Hartfield.\"\\n\\nSome time afterwards it was, \"I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\\nsurprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would--for\\nMiss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a\\nlinen-draper.\"\\n\\n\"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher\\nof a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an\\nopportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear\\nvaluable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she\\nis quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be\\namong the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I\\nare the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained\\nthemselves.\"\\n\\nHarriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that\\npeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\\ncheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\\nthe rejected Mr. Martin.\\n\\n\"Now he has got my letter,\" said she softly. \"I wonder what they are all\\ndoing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy, they will be unhappy\\ntoo. I hope he will not mind it so very much.\"\\n\\n\"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\\nemployed,\" cried Emma. \"At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing\\nyour picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\\nis the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,\\nallowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.\"\\n\\n\"My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street.\"\\n\\n\"Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest\\nHarriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till\\njust before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this\\nevening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\\nit introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those\\npleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\\nprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy\\ntheir imaginations all are!\"\\n\\nHarriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nHarriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been\\nspending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have\\na bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every\\nrespect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible\\njust at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or\\ntwo to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that she should\\nreturn to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.\\n\\nWhile she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.\\nWoodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his\\nmind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was\\ninduced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his\\nown civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley,\\nwho had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short,\\ndecided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and\\ncivil hesitations of the other.\\n\\n\"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not\\nconsider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice and\\ngo out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had\\nbetter take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,\\nMr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.\"\\n\\n\"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to\\nentertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my\\nthree turns--my winter walk.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot do better, sir.\"\\n\\n\"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a\\nvery slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you\\nhave another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think\\nthe sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the\\ngarden door for you.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\\nimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more\\nchat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more\\nvoluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\\n\\n\"I cannot rate her beauty as you do,\" said he; \"but she is a\\npretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her\\ndisposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good\\nhands she will turn out a valuable woman.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be\\nwanting.\"\\n\\n\"Come,\" said he, \"you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you\\nthat you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl's\\ngiggle; she really does you credit.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been\\nof some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they\\nmay. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.\"\\n\\n\"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?\"\\n\\n\"Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she\\nintended.\"\\n\\n\"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!\"\\n\\n\"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.\"\\n\\nEmma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said\\nnothing. He presently added, with a smile,\\n\\n\"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that\\nI have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of\\nsomething to her advantage.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! how so? of what sort?\"\\n\\n\"A very serious sort, I assure you;\" still smiling.\\n\\n\"Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love with her?\\nWho makes you their confidant?\"\\n\\nEmma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.\\nMr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew Mr.\\nElton looked up to him.\\n\\n\"I have reason to think,\" he replied, \"that Harriet Smith will soon have\\nan offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert\\nMartin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have\\ndone his business. He is desperately in love and means to marry her.\"\\n\\n\"He is very obliging,\" said Emma; \"but is he sure that Harriet means to\\nmarry him?\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to\\nthe Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows\\nI have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,\\nconsiders me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether\\nI thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether\\nI thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\\naltogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\\n(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\\nabove him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\\nbetter sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\\npurpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\\nthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and\\nbrother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me\\nthat he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\\ncould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\\nhim away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\\nwould have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\\nthinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened\\nthe night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow\\nmuch time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear\\nto have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs.\\nGoddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking\\nhim at all a tiresome wretch.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\\nthrough a great part of this speech, \"how do you know that Mr. Martin\\ndid not speak yesterday?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not absolutely know it; but it\\nmay be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?\"\\n\\n\"Come,\" said she, \"I will tell you something, in return for what\\nyou have told me. He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was\\nrefused.\"\\n\\nThis was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\\nKnightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood\\nup, in tall indignation, and said,\\n\\n\"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the\\nfoolish girl about?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! to be sure,\" cried Emma, \"it is always incomprehensible to a man\\nthat a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\\nimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the\\nmeaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\\nso; but I hope you are mistaken.\"\\n\\n\"I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.\"\\n\\n\"You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your\\ndoing. You persuaded her to refuse him.\"\\n\\n\"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\\nfeel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,\\nbut I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized\\nindeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he\\ndoes seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever\\ngot over.\"\\n\\n\"Not Harriet's equal!\" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and\\nwith calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \"No, he is\\nnot her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\\nsituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\\nHarriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\\nconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\\nnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\\ncertainly no respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder\\nat a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any\\ninformation. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and\\ntoo simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have\\nno experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have\\nany that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and\\nthat is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account,\\nas being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that,\\nas to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as\\nto a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I\\ncould not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there\\nbeing no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in\\ngood hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.\\nThe advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the\\nsmallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out\\nupon her extreme good luck. Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.\\nIt crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's\\nleaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well. I remember\\nsaying to myself, 'Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will\\nthink this a good match.'\"\\n\\n\"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any\\nsuch thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all his\\nmerit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend!\\nNot regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom\\nI could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you should\\nthink it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine are\\nvery different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are\\nnot just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated very differently\\nby others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two,\\nbut he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in\\nwhich she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation.\"\\n\\n\"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\\nrespectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\"\\n\\n\"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\\nbe called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\\nfor the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\\nwhom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\\nis a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is\\nvery liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\\ncomfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; that\\nshe associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\\ndeny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\"\\n\\n\"Whoever might be her parents,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"whoever may have\\nhad the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\\ntheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. After\\nreceiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard's\\nhands to shift as she can;--to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line,\\nto have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought\\nthis good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough. She desired nothing\\nbetter herself. Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had\\nno distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was as\\nhappy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She had no sense of\\nsuperiority then. If she has it now, you have given it. You have been no\\nfriend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded\\nso far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to\\nhim. I know him well. He has too much real feeling to address any\\nwoman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he is\\nthe farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he had\\nencouragement.\"\\n\\nIt was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\\nassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject\\nagain.\\n\\n\"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,\\nare unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not so\\ncontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\\nhas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her\\nunderstanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and\\nsupposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured,\\nlet me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not\\ntrivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a\\nbeautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an\\nhundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the\\nsubject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall\\nin love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with\\nsuch loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought\\nafter, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a\\nclaim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim,\\ncomprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and\\nmanner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to\\nbe pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken if your sex in\\ngeneral would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims\\na woman could possess.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost\\nenough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply\\nit as you do.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure!\" cried she playfully. \"I know _that_ is the feeling of\\nyou all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every\\nman delights in--what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his\\njudgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to\\nmarry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just\\nentering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at\\nbecause she does not accept the first offer she receives? No--pray let\\nher have time to look about her.\"\\n\\n\"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,\" said Mr. Knightley\\npresently, \"though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive\\nthat it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her up\\nwith such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that,\\nin a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her.\\nVanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing\\nso easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. Miss\\nHarriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though\\nshe is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to\\nsay, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of\\nconnecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent\\nmen would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be\\ninvolved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Let\\nher marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for\\never; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her\\nto be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large\\nfortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest\\nof her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry\\nsomebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the\\nold writing-master's son.\"\\n\\n\"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there\\ncan be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more\\nangry. But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible;\\nshe has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any\\nsecond application. She must abide by the evil of having refused him,\\nwhatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to\\nsay that I might not influence her a little; but I assure you there\\nwas very little for me or for any body to do. His appearance is so much\\nagainst him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to\\nfavour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that before she had seen\\nany body superior, she might tolerate him. He was the brother of her\\nfriends, and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen\\nnobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not,\\nwhile she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable. But the case\\nis altered now. She knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a\\ngentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!\" cried Mr.\\nKnightley.--\"Robert Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and\\ngood-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility than\\nHarriet Smith could understand.\"\\n\\nEmma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was\\nreally feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She\\ndid not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better\\njudge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;\\nbut yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,\\nwhich made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him\\nsitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.\\nSome minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt\\non Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was\\nthinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.\\n\\n\"Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I hope it\\nwill not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known\\nto yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it\\nis fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;--and as\\na friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it\\nwill be all labour in vain.\"\\n\\nEmma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,\\nand a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make\\nan imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any\\nbody. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is\\nas well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet's.\\nHe knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite\\nwherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved\\nmoments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does\\nnot mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great\\nanimation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are\\nintimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.\"\\n\\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Emma, laughing again. \"If I had\\nset my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very\\nkind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to\\nmyself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\\nequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning to you,\"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was\\nvery much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was\\nmortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he had\\ngiven; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair,\\nwas provoking him exceedingly.\\n\\nEmma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\\nindistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his. She did not always\\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\\nher opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He\\nwalked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She\\nwas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and\\nthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet's staying\\naway so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility of the\\nyoung man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting with\\nHarriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\\nHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any\\nsuch reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which woman's\\nfriendship and woman's feelings would not justify.\\n\\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither\\nwith the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of\\nMr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such\\na question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, she\\nwas able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfully\\nto be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly might have\\nheard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done, and\\nMr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to\\nmoney matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise\\nto them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the\\ninfluence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr.\\nKnightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its\\neffects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming\\nany hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and\\nmore than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure\\ndid not belong to Mr. Elton.\\n\\nHarriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\\nto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\\ntelling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\\ndelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child,\\nand Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\\ncoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\\nfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road\\nto London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\\nwhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\\nPerry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\\nwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much to\\npersuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\\ndo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_\\n_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\\nnot put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a\\nvery enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\\nprecious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very sure\\nthere must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton\\nonly looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.\\nMiss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more about\\nMr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her, \"that she did\\nnot pretend to understand what his business might be, but she only\\nknew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should think the\\nluckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his\\nequal for beauty or agreeableness.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nMr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with\\nherself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before\\nhe came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks\\nshewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not repent.\\nOn the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more justified\\nand endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days.\\n\\nThe Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.\\nElton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\\nsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences\\nof admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were\\nvisibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as\\nher youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied\\nof Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a\\ncontrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.\\n\\nHer views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal of\\nuseful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few\\nfirst chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much\\neasier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination\\nrange and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge\\nher comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary\\npursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she\\nwas making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing\\nall the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin\\nquarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with\\nciphers and trophies.\\n\\nIn this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are\\nnot uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written out\\nat least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it\\nfrom her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more.\\nEmma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote\\na very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first\\norder, in form as well as quantity.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the\\ngirls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting\\nin. \"So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he\\nwondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.\"\\nAnd it always ended in \"Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\"\\n\\nHis good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,\\ndid not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he\\nhad desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,\\nsomething, he thought, might come from that quarter.\\n\\nIt was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of Highbury\\nin general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one\\nwhose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really good\\nenigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had\\nthe pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections;\\nand at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that\\nnothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the\\nsex should pass his lips. They owed to him their two or three politest\\npuzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled, and\\nrather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,\\n\\n    My first doth affliction denote,\\n      Which my second is destin'd to feel\\n    And my whole is the best antidote\\n      That affliction to soften and heal.--\\n\\nmade her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some\\npages ago already.\\n\\n\"Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?\" said she; \"that\\nis the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his\\nlife. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse\"--he\\nstopt a moment--\"or Miss Smith could inspire him.\"\\n\\nThe very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He\\ncalled for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table\\ncontaining, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed\\nto a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his\\nmanner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.\\n\\n\"I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection,\" said he. \"Being my\\nfriend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,\\nbut perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.\"\\n\\nThe speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could\\nunderstand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found\\nit easier to meet her eye than her friend's. He was gone the next\\nmoment:--after another moment's pause,\\n\\n\"Take it,\" said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards\\nHarriet--\"it is for you. Take your own.\"\\n\\nBut Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never\\nloth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.\\n\\n        To Miss--\\n\\n          CHARADE.\\n\\n    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\\n      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\\n    Another view of man, my second brings,\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\n    But ah! united, what reverse we have!\\n      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown;\\n    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\n      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,\\n      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\\n\\nShe cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through\\nagain to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then\\npassing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself, while\\nHarriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and\\ndulness, \"Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse\\ncharades. _Courtship_--a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This\\nis feeling your way. This is saying very plainly--'Pray, Miss Smith,\\ngive me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and my\\nintentions in the same glance.'\\n\\n      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\\n\\nHarriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets, the\\njustest that could be given.\\n\\n      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.\\n\\nHumph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in\\nlove, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the\\nbenefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life\\nyou would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade\\nindeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon\\nnow.\"\\n\\nShe was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,\\nwhich were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the\\neagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.\\n\\n\"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I\\ncannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find\\nit out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it\\nkingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be the young lady.\\nDo you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?\\n\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\nCan it be Neptune?\\n\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\nOr a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one\\nsyllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!\\nMiss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?\"\\n\\n\"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking\\nof? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend\\nupon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.\\n\\nFor Miss ------, read Miss Smith.\\n\\n    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\\n      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\\n\\nThat is _court_.\\n\\n    Another view of man, my second brings;\\n      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\nThat is _ship_;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.\\n\\n    But ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!\\n      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown.\\n    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\\n      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\nA very proper compliment!--and then follows the application, which\\nI think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in\\ncomprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of\\nits being written for you and to you.\"\\n\\nHarriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read\\nthe concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not\\nspeak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.\\nEmma spoke for her.\\n\\n\"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,\"\\nsaid she, \"that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions. You\\nare his object--and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I\\nthought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now, it\\nis clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on\\nthe subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so long\\nhave I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened.\\nI could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were\\nmost desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have\\nreally so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my\\ndear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may\\nwell feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing\\nbut good. It will give you every thing that you want--consideration,\\nindependence, a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your\\nreal friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy\\nfor ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in\\neither of us.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Miss Woodhouse!\"--and \"Dear Miss Woodhouse,\" was all that Harriet,\\nwith many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did\\narrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear to\\nher friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as she\\nought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.\\n\\n\"Whatever you say is always right,\" cried Harriet, \"and therefore I\\nsuppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not\\nhave imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,\\nwho might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He\\nis so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses--'To Miss ------.'\\nDear me, how clever!--Could it really be meant for me?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a\\ncertainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to\\nthe play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by\\nmatter-of-fact prose.\"\\n\\n\"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure,\\na month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do take\\nplace!\"\\n\\n\"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and\\nreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so\\nevidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement of\\nother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\\nYou and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one\\nanother by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying\\nwill be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a\\nsomething in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right\\ndirection, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.\\n\\n      The course of true love never did run smooth--\\n\\nA Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that\\npassage.\"\\n\\n\"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,\\nwho did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very\\nhandsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,\\nquite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body\\nsays he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it;\\nthat he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so\\nexcellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has\\never preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back\\nto the first time I saw him! How little did I think!--The two Abbots and\\nI ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he\\nwas going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look\\nthrough herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me\\nlook too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he\\nlooked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.\"\\n\\n\"This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be, must\\nbe agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we\\nare not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to\\nsee you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives\\nevery assurance of it;--if they wish to have you settled in the same\\ncountry and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will\\nbe accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the\\ncommon phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the\\nrespectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You understand\\nevery thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other. This\\ncharade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have made any\\nthing like it.\"\\n\\n\"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\\nyesterday.\"\\n\\n\"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.\"\\n\\n\"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.\"\\n\\n\"It is as long again as almost all we have had before.\"\\n\\n\"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things\\nin general cannot be too short.\"\\n\\nHarriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory\\ncomparisons were rising in her mind.\\n\\n\"It is one thing,\" said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--\"to have\\nvery good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is\\nany thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you\\nmust, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like\\nthis.\"\\n\\nEmma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's\\nprose.\\n\\n\"Such sweet lines!\" continued Harriet--\"these two last!--But how shall I\\never be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?--Oh! Miss\\nWoodhouse, what can we do about that?\"\\n\\n\"Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\\nsay, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will\\npass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall\\nchuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\\ncharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.\"\\n\\n\"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not\\nwrite it into your book.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but those two lines are\"--\\n\\n--\"The best of all. Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private\\nenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\\nbecause you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\\nmeaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a\\nvery pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend upon\\nit, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better than his\\npassion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or\\nneither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be\\nno possible reflection on you.\"\\n\\nHarriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,\\nso as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a\\ndeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\\nof publicity.\\n\\n\"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,\" said she.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" replied Emma; \"a most natural feeling; and the longer it\\nlasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you\\nwill not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him\\nso much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any\\nthing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of\\ngallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him.\"\\n\\nHarriet looked grave.\\n\\n\"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You\\nwill betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too\\nquick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning\\nwhich may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\\ntribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not\\nhave left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me\\nthan towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has\\nencouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over\\nthis charade.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\\nrecurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \"Well, my dears, how does\\nyour book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\\npiece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt, we suppose,\\nby a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\\nit in.\"\\n\\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\\ndistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\\npart as she proceeded--and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\\nforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\\n\\n\"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true.\\n'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I\\ncan easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so\\nprettily, but you, Emma.\"\\n\\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a very\\ntender sigh, he added,\\n\\n\"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\\nremember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have\\nheard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\\nseveral.\\n\\n    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,\\n      Kindled a flame I yet deplore,\\n    The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,\\n    Though of his near approach afraid,\\n      So fatal to my suit before.\\n\\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever all\\nthe way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\\nElegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.\\n\\n    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\\n\\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\\nchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\\nnext week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her--and what\\nroom there will be for the children?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\\nhas;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual, you\\nknow. Why should there be any change?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not\\nsince last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley's\\nbeing a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken\\naway from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see\\nMiss Taylor here!\"\\n\\n\"She will not be surprized, papa, at least.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\\nfirst heard she was going to be married.\"\\n\\n\"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\\nhere.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she\\nis coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.\"\\n\\n\"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case of\\nnecessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\\nought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\\nthey can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken\\nout for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this\\nChristmas--though you know it is longer since they were with him, than\\nwith us.\"\\n\\n\"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\\nanywhere but at Hartfield.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on his\\nbrother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat musing\\na little while, and then said,\\n\\n\"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\\nsoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\\nstay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I\\ndo not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\\nhusband.\"\\n\\nThis was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\\nby the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she immediately\\nled to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\\n\\n\"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother\\nand sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the children.\\nWe are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder which she\\nwill think the handsomest, Henry or John?\"\\n\\n\"Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\\nto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.\"\\n\\n\"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\\neldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,\\nis named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that\\nthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\\nthought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They\\nare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will\\ncome and stand by my chair, and say, 'Grandpapa, can you give me a bit\\nof string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives\\nwere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with\\nthem very often.\"\\n\\n\"He appears rough to you,\" said Emma, \"because you are so very gentle\\nyourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not\\nthink him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if\\nthey misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an\\naffectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate\\nfather. The children are all fond of him.\"\\n\\n\"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a\\nvery frightful way!\"\\n\\n\"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such\\nenjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of\\ntheir taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I cannot understand it.\"\\n\\n\"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot\\nunderstand the pleasures of the other.\"\\n\\nLater in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate\\nin preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of this\\ninimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could\\nreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in\\nhis the consciousness of having made a push--of having thrown a die;\\nand she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible\\nreason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made\\nup in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest\\ndegree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give\\nway; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his\\ndining with him--had made such a point of it, that he had promised him\\nconditionally to come.\\n\\nEmma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend\\non their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged--she\\nre-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the\\npaper from the table, she returned it--\\n\\n\"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank\\nyou for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have ventured\\nto write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will not take it\\namiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight\\nlines.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked rather\\ndoubtingly--rather confused; said something about \"honour,\"--glanced at\\nEmma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took\\nit up, and examined it very attentively. With the view of passing off an\\nawkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\\n\\n\"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade\\nmust not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman's\\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.\"\\n\\n\"I have no hesitation in saying,\" replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\\na good deal while he spoke; \"I have no hesitation in saying--at least\\nif my friend feels at all as _I_ do--I have not the smallest doubt that,\\ncould he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at the\\nbook again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the\\nproudest moment of his life.\"\\n\\nAfter this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think\\nit too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was\\na sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to\\nlaugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and\\nthe sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nThough now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\\nprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\\nmorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\\nlived a little way out of Highbury.\\n\\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of\\nthe place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of Mr.\\nElton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about\\na quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and not\\nvery good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\\nno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\\npresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\\nof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\\neyes.--Emma's remark was--\\n\\n\"There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\\ndays.\"--Harriet's was--\\n\\n\"Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow\\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.\"\\n\\n\"I do not often walk this way _now_,\" said Emma, as they proceeded, \"but\\n_then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately\\nacquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part\\nof Highbury.\"\\n\\nHarriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage,\\nand her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors\\nand probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with\\nMr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.\\n\\n\"I wish we could contrive it,\" said she; \"but I cannot think of any\\ntolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquire\\nabout of his housekeeper--no message from my father.\"\\n\\nShe pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of some\\nminutes, Harriet thus began again--\\n\\n\"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\\ngoing to be married! so charming as you are!\"--\\n\\nEmma laughed, and replied,\\n\\n\"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\\nI must find other people charming--one other person at least. And I\\nam not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\\nintention of ever marrying at all.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it.\"\\n\\n\"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\\nquestion: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather not\\nbe tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, I\\nmust expect to repent it.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!\"--\\n\\n\"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\\nin love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been in\\nlove; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.\\nAnd, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\\nsituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\\nconsequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\\nmistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never\\ncould I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and\\nalways right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.\"\\n\\n\"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\"\\n\\n\"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if\\nI thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--so\\nsmiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--and so apt\\nto tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\\nto-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any\\nlikeness, except in being unmarried.\"\\n\\n\"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\\nonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\\nwoman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old\\nmaid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of good\\nfortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant\\nas any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much against the\\ncandour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very\\nnarrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.\\nThose who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and\\ngenerally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. This\\ndoes not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good natured and\\ntoo silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much to the taste\\nof every body, though single and though poor. Poverty certainly has not\\ncontracted her mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the\\nworld, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody\\nis afraid of her: that is a great charm.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\\ngrow old?\"\\n\\n\"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\\nin want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman's\\nusual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\\nare now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\\nmore; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\\nobjects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\\ngreat point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil\\nto be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\\nchildren of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be enough\\nof them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation that\\ndeclining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and every\\nfear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it\\nsuits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder. My\\nnephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\\na hundred times--but are you acquainted?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\\nHighbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\\nwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\\nhalf so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\\nFairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from\\nher is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go round\\nand round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a\\nstomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears of\\nnothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires\\nme to death.\"\\n\\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\\nsuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\\nwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\\ncounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\\ncould allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\\nexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\\ndone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\\nalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\\nthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\\ncame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\\nthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\\n\\n\"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\\nevery thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\\nthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\\nsoon it may all vanish from my mind?\"\\n\\n\"Very true,\" said Harriet. \"Poor creatures! one can think of nothing\\nelse.\"\\n\\n\"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,\" said\\nEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended\\nthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them\\ninto the lane again. \"I do not think it will,\" stopping to look once\\nmore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still\\ngreater within.\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, no,\" said her companion.\\n\\nThey walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was\\npassed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma\\ntime only to say farther,\\n\\n\"Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good\\nthoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion\\nhas produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that\\nis truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can\\nfor them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.\"\\n\\nHarriet could just answer, \"Oh! dear, yes,\" before the gentleman joined\\nthem. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the\\nfirst subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit\\nhe would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about\\nwhat could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to\\naccompany them.\\n\\n\"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,\" thought Emma;\\n\"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase\\nof love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\\ndeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.\"\\n\\nAnxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one\\nside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had\\nnot been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of\\ndependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\\nthey would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\\nstopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\\nof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\\nfootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would\\nfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time\\nshe judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the comfort\\nof farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from the\\ncottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to fetch\\nbroth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk to\\nand question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would have\\nbeen the most natural, had she been acting just then without design;\\nand by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without\\nany obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\\ninvoluntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow;\\nand she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in\\na conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\\nanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\\nhaving sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back\\na little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join\\nthem.\\n\\nMr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\\nand Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only\\ngiving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his\\nfriend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese,\\nthe north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all the\\ndessert.\\n\\n\"This would soon have led to something better, of course,\" was her\\nconsoling reflection; \"any thing interests between those who love; and\\nany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I\\ncould but have kept longer away!\"\\n\\nThey now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\\npales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the\\nhouse, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot, and\\nfall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off short,\\nand dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to\\nentreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself to\\nrights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\\n\\n\"Part of my lace is gone,\" said she, \"and I do not know how I am to\\ncontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\\nhope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop\\nat your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string,\\nor any thing just to keep my boot on.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could\\nexceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and\\nendeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they were\\ntaken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind\\nit was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between\\nthem was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive\\nher assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged to leave\\nthe door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton\\nshould close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but\\nby engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make\\nit practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining\\nroom. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It could be\\nprotracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and make her\\nappearance.\\n\\nThe lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\\nfavourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of having\\nschemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to the point.\\nHe had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet that\\nhe had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little\\ngallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.\\n\\n\"Cautious, very cautious,\" thought Emma; \"he advances inch by inch, and\\nwill hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\"\\n\\nStill, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\\ningenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\\nthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them\\nforward to the great event.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nMr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's power\\nto superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her\\nsister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,\\nand then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;\\nand during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be\\nexpected--she did not herself expect--that any thing beyond occasional,\\nfortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They might\\nadvance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or\\nother whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more leisure\\nfor them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they\\nwill do for themselves.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent\\nfrom Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.\\nTill this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been\\ndivided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of\\nthis autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was\\ntherefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their\\nSurry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be\\ninduced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and\\nwho consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in\\nforestalling this too short visit.\\n\\nHe thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little\\nof the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some\\nof the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;\\nthe sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John\\nKnightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids,\\nall reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival,\\nthe many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed\\nand disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could\\nnot have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even\\nfor this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father\\nwere so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal\\nsolicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their\\nhaving instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and\\ndrinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for,\\nwithout the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long\\na disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance\\non them.\\n\\nMrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet\\nmanners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt\\nup in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly\\nattached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a\\nwarmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a fault\\nin any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or any\\nquickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited also\\nmuch of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful\\nof that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond\\nof her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.\\nThey were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong\\nhabit of regard for every old acquaintance.\\n\\nMr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\\nrising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private\\ncharacter; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally\\npleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He was not an\\nill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a\\nreproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with\\nsuch a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects\\nin it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of her temper\\nmust hurt his. He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she\\nwanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.\\n\\nHe was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong\\nin him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to\\nIsabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have\\npassed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister,\\nbut they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without\\npraise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal\\ncompliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of\\nall in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful\\nforbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience\\nthat could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and\\nfidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or\\nsharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John\\nKnightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally\\na strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma's\\ncharity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently\\nto be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of\\nevery visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of\\nnecessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.\\nThey had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a\\nmelancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's attention\\nto the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.\\n\\n\"Ah, my dear,\" said he, \"poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, sir,\" cried she with ready sympathy, \"how you must miss her!\\nAnd dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--I have been so\\ngrieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without\\nher.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pretty well, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the\\nplace agrees with her tolerably.\"\\n\\nMr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts\\nof the air of Randalls.\\n\\n\"Oh! no--none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my\\nlife--never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.\"\\n\\n\"Very much to the honour of both,\" was the handsome reply.\\n\\n\"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?\" asked Isabella in the\\nplaintive tone which just suited her father.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse hesitated.--\"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they\\nmarried. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,\\nhave we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,\\neither at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, most\\nfrequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston\\nis really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way,\\nyou will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be\\naware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be\\nassured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by\\nany means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact\\ntruth.\"\\n\\n\"Just as it should be,\" said Mr. John Knightley, \"and just as I hoped\\nit was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not be\\ndoubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I\\nhave been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change\\nbeing so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have\\nEmma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.\"\\n\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said Mr. Woodhouse--\"yes, certainly--I cannot\\ndeny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\\noften--but then--she is always obliged to go away again.\"\\n\\n\"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--You quite\\nforget poor Mr. Weston.\"\\n\\n\"I think, indeed,\" said John Knightley pleasantly, \"that Mr. Weston has\\nsome little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the\\npoor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims\\nof the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella,\\nshe has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all\\nthe Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\"\\n\\n\"Me, my love,\" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--\\n\"Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\\ngreater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\\nthe misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss\\nTaylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting\\nMr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does\\nnot deserve. I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever\\nexisted. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal\\nfor temper. I shall never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that\\nvery windy day last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last\\nSeptember twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night,\\non purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I\\nhave been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better\\nman in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.\"\\n\\n\"Where is the young man?\" said John Knightley. \"Has he been here on this\\noccasion--or has he not?\"\\n\\n\"He has not been here yet,\" replied Emma. \"There was a strong\\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\\nnothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\"\\n\\n\"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\" said her father.\\n\"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\\nproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\\nwell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\\ncannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--\"\\n\\n\"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\"\\n\\n\"Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought\\nit--and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well,\\ntime does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. However, it was an\\nexceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal\\nof pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\\n28th--and began, 'My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on; and it\\nwas signed 'F. C. Weston Churchill.'--I remember that perfectly.\"\\n\\n\"How very pleasing and proper of him!\" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\\nKnightley. \"I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But\\nhow sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\\nsomething so shocking in a child's being taken away from his parents and\\nnatural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with\\nhim. To give up one's child! I really never could think well of any body\\nwho proposed such a thing to any body else.\"\\n\\n\"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\" observed Mr.\\nJohn Knightley coolly. \"But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt\\nwhat you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is rather\\nan easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes\\nthings as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other,\\ndepending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his\\ncomforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing\\nwhist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection,\\nor any thing that home affords.\"\\n\\nEmma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had\\nhalf a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She\\nwould keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and\\nvaluable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to\\nhimself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down on\\nthe common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was\\nimportant.--It had a high claim to forbearance.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nMr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination of\\nMr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in\\nIsabella's first day. Emma's sense of right however had decided it;\\nand besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had\\nparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement\\nbetween Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper\\ninvitation.\\n\\nShe hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time\\nto make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She_ certainly had not been\\nin the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had. Concession must be\\nout of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had\\never quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of\\nfriendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the children\\nwith her--the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who\\nwas now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced\\nabout in her aunt's arms. It did assist; for though he began with grave\\nlooks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in\\nthe usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with all the\\nunceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again;\\nand the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then\\na little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the\\nbaby,\\n\\n\"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.\\nAs to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with\\nregard to these children, I observe we never disagree.\"\\n\\n\"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women,\\nand as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with\\nthem, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always\\nthink alike.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being in the\\nwrong.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, smiling--\"and reason good. I was sixteen years old when\\nyou were born.\"\\n\\n\"A material difference then,\" she replied--\"and no doubt you were much\\nmy superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the\\nlapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal\\nnearer?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--a good deal _nearer_.\"\\n\\n\"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we\\nthink differently.\"\\n\\n\"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by\\nnot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,\\nlet us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little\\nEmma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old\\ngrievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.\"\\n\\n\"That's true,\" she cried--\"very true. Little Emma, grow up a better\\nwoman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.\\nNow, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good\\nintentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects on\\nmy side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know that\\nMr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.\"\\n\\n\"A man cannot be more so,\" was his short, full answer.\\n\\n\"Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.\"\\n\\nThis had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightley\\nmade his appearance, and \"How d'ye do, George?\" and \"John, how are\\nyou?\" succeeded in the true English style, burying under a calmness that\\nseemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have led\\neither of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the\\nother.\\n\\nThe evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards\\nentirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and\\nthe little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his\\ndaughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally\\ndistinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma only occasionally joining in\\none or the other.\\n\\nThe brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally\\nof those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,\\nand who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had generally\\nsome point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curious\\nanecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at\\nDonwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to\\ngive all such local information as could not fail of being interesting\\nto a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his\\nlife, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a drain, the change\\nof a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre for\\nwheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much equality\\nof interest by John, as his cooler manners rendered possible; and if his\\nwilling brother ever left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries\\neven approached a tone of eagerness.\\n\\nWhile they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a\\nfull flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\\n\\n\"My poor dear Isabella,\" said he, fondly taking her hand, and\\ninterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her\\nfive children--\"How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\\nAnd how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,\\nmy dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and\\nI will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all\\nhave a little gruel.\"\\n\\nEmma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both the\\nMr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;--and\\ntwo basins only were ordered. After a little more discourse in praise of\\ngruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every\\nbody, he proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection,\\n\\n\"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South\\nEnd instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we should not\\nhave gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for\\nthe weakness in little Bella's throat,--both sea air and bathing.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any\\ngood; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though\\nperhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use\\nto any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.\"\\n\\n\"Come, come,\" cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, \"I must\\nbeg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;--I\\nwho have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear\\nIsabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; and\\nhe never forgets you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he has\\nnot time to take care of himself--he tells me he has not time to take\\ncare of himself--which is very sad--but he is always wanted all round\\nthe country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere. But\\nthen there is not so clever a man any where.\"\\n\\n\"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?\\nI have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He\\nwill be so pleased to see my little ones.\"\\n\\n\"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\\nhim about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes,\\nyou had better let him look at little Bella's throat.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\\nuneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to\\nher, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\\nWingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since August.\"\\n\\n\"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use\\nto her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\\nspoken to--\\n\\n\"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,\" said Emma, \"I\\nhave not heard one inquiry after them.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you mention\\nthem in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.\\nBates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.--They\\nare always so pleased to see my children.--And that excellent Miss\\nBates!--such thorough worthy people!--How are they, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a\\nbad cold about a month ago.\"\\n\\n\"How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\\nthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more\\ngeneral or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.\"\\n\\n\"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you\\nmention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy\\nas he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it\\naltogether a sickly season.\"\\n\\n\"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly\\nexcept--\\n\\n\"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always\\na sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a\\ndreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--and the\\nair so bad!\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is\\nvery superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London\\nin general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\\ndifferent from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be\\nunwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--there is\\nhardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in:\\nbut _we_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of\\nBrunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it--but\\nafter you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different\\ncreatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I think\\nyou are any of you looking well at present.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\\nlittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\\nfree from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\\nrather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a\\nlittle more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of\\ncoming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\\nassure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\\nsent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that\\nyou do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,\" turning her eyes with\\naffectionate anxiety towards her husband.\\n\\n\"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley\\nvery far from looking well.\"\\n\\n\"What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?\" cried Mr. John\\nKnightley, hearing his own name.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\\nwell--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\\nwished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you\\nleft home.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Isabella,\"--exclaimed he hastily--\"pray do not concern yourself\\nabout my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and\\nthe children, and let me look as I chuse.\"\\n\\n\"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,\"\\ncried Emma, \"about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff\\nfrom Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will\\nnot the old prejudice be too strong?\"\\n\\nAnd she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced to\\ngive her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\\nworse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\\nFairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\\nmoment very happy to assist in praising.\\n\\n\"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!\" said Mrs. John Knightley.--\"It\\nis so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\\naccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\\nregret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be more at\\nHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\\nCampbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\\ndelightful companion for Emma.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\\n\\n\"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\\nkind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a\\nbetter companion than Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so\\nvery accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age.\"\\n\\nThis topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\\nmoment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\\nclose without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied\\na great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--undoubting\\ndecision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty\\nsevere Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\\ntolerably;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\\nhad to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\\nher own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\\nhad been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth\\ngruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\\nit, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\\ndangerous opening.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\\nwith tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, \"Ah!\\nthere is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\\ndoes not bear talking of.\" And for a little while she hoped he would not\\ntalk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to\\nthe relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes,\\nhowever, he began with,\\n\\n\"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\\ninstead of coming here.\"\\n\\n\"But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children a\\ngreat deal of good.\"\\n\\n\"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\\nto South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to\\nhear you had fixed upon South End.\"\\n\\n\"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\\na mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there, never\\nfound the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\\nentirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\\nbe depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and\\nhis own brother and family have been there repeatedly.\"\\n\\n\"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--Perry\\nwas a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\\nsea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by\\nwhat I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\\nthe sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You should have\\nconsulted Perry.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how\\ngreat it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\\nchuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,\\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into\\na worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\\nill-judged measure.\"\\n\\nEmma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he\\nhad reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\\nbrother-in-law's breaking out.\\n\\n\"Mr. Perry,\" said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, \"would do\\nas well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it\\nany business of his, to wonder at what I do?--at my taking my family to\\none part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\\nmy judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--I want his directions no more than\\nhis drugs.\" He paused--and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only\\nsarcastic dryness, \"If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and\\nfive children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater\\nexpense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\\nwilling to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.\"\\n\\n\"True, true,\" cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--\"very\\ntrue. That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I was telling\\nyou of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the\\nright that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive\\nany difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of\\ninconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly\\nthe present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,\\nwill be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow\\nmorning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me\\nyour opinion.\"\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his\\nfriend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been\\nattributing many of his own feelings and expressions;--but the soothing\\nattentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and\\nthe immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the\\nother, prevented any renewal of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nThere could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John\\nKnightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\\namong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over what\\nshe had done every evening with her father and sister. She had nothing\\nto wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a\\ndelightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.\\n\\nIn general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their\\nmornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,\\nthere was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no\\ndenial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was\\npersuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of\\nthe party.\\n\\nHow they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he\\ncould, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually\\nat Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on\\nthat head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long\\nto convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for\\nHarriet also.\\n\\nHarriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the\\nonly persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early, as\\nwell as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination being\\nconsulted in every thing.\\n\\nThe evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that\\nMr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent\\nby Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with\\na cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.\\nGoddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma called\\non her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to\\nRandalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard\\nwas full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet\\nherself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her\\nfrom this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss\\nwithout many tears.\\n\\nEmma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's\\nunavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr.\\nElton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last\\ntolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most\\ncomfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had not\\nadvanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she was met by Mr.\\nElton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly\\ntogether in conversation about the invalid--of whom he, on the rumour\\nof considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he might\\ncarry some report of her to Hartfield--they were overtaken by Mr. John\\nKnightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest\\nboys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country\\nrun, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice\\npudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and\\nproceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's\\ncomplaint;--\"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat\\nabout her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.\\nGoddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\\nalarmed her with them.\" Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as\\nhe exclaimed,\\n\\n\"A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\\ninfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\\nyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.\\nWhy does not Perry see her?\"\\n\\nEmma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and\\ncare; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she\\ncould not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist\\nthan not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite another subject,\\n\\n\"It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much like\\nsnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\\nshould really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father from\\nventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the\\ncold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great\\na disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton,\\nin your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me a\\nlittle hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\\nwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\\ncommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.\"\\n\\nMr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\\nwhich was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\\ncare of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's,\\nhe had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--but Emma,\\ntoo eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him\\nimpartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied with\\nhis muttering acknowledgment of its being \"very cold, certainly very\\ncold,\" and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls,\\nand secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour\\nof the evening.\\n\\n\"You do quite right,\" said she;--\"we will make your apologies to Mr. and\\nMrs. Weston.\"\\n\\nBut hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\\noffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only\\nobjection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt\\nsatisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had\\nhis broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;\\nnever had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when\\nhe next looked at her.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said she to herself, \"this is most strange!--After I had got\\nhim off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill\\nbehind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men,\\nespecially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining\\nout--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,\\ntheir employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any\\nthing gives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most\\nvaluable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love\\nwith Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine\\nout wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see ready\\nwit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.\"\\n\\nSoon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his\\nmanner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while\\nassuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her fair\\nfriend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting\\nher again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and\\nhe sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of\\napprobation much in his favour.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began\\nwith--\\n\\n\"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.\\nElton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\\nmen he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please,\\nevery feature works.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,\" replied Emma; \"but where there is\\na wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great\\ndeal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will\\nhave the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect\\ngood-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, \"he seems\\nto have a great deal of good-will towards you.\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining me to\\nbe Mr. Elton's object?\"\\n\\n\"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!\"\\n\\n\"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it\\nis so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\\nmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\\nlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and\\nI are very good friends, and nothing more;\" and she walked on, amusing\\nherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\\npartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high\\npretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well\\npleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and in\\nwant of counsel. He said no more.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\\nspite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinking\\nfrom it, and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest\\ndaughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the\\nweather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his own\\ngoing, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was\\ncold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was severe;\\nand by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow\\nwere finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so\\novercharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world\\nin a very short time.\\n\\nEmma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\\npreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\\nhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\\nwhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\\ndiscontent.\\n\\n\"A man,\" said he, \"must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks\\npeople to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\\nthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\\nagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\\nabsurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--The folly of not allowing\\npeople to be comfortable at home--and the folly of people's not staying\\ncomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such\\nan evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\\nshould deem it;--and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\\nthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\\nthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\\nor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\\nthat he can;--here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\\nanother man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses and\\nfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\\ncreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\\nat home.\"\\n\\nEmma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no\\ndoubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the \"Very true,\\nmy love,\" which must have been usually administered by his travelling\\ncompanion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making\\nany answer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being\\nquarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to\\ntalk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\\nher lips.\\n\\nThey arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton,\\nspruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma thought with\\npleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all obligation and\\ncheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she\\nbegan to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from\\nwhat had reached her. She had sent while dressing, and the answer had\\nbeen, \"Much the same--not better.\"\\n\\n\"_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard's,\" said she presently, \"was not so\\npleasant as I had hoped--'Not better' was _my_ answer.\"\\n\\nHis face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of\\nsentiment as he answered.\\n\\n\"Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that\\nwhen I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing\\nbefore I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\\nby no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned--I\\nhad flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I\\nknew had been given her in the morning.\"\\n\\nEmma smiled and answered--\"My visit was of use to the nervous part of\\nher complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;\\nit is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\\nprobably heard.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--\"\\n\\n\"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!\"\\n\\n\"Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.\"\\n\\nThis was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\\nestimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay\\nwhen only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\\n\\n\"What an excellent device,\" said he, \"the use of a sheepskin for\\ncarriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold\\nwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\\nrendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\\nand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\\nunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\\ncold afternoon--but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha!\\nsnows a little I see.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said John Knightley, \"and I think we shall have a good deal of\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Christmas weather,\" observed Mr. Elton. \"Quite seasonable; and\\nextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\\nyesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly\\nhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\\nmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\\nthe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites\\ntheir friends about them, and people think little of even the worst\\nweather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing\\ncould be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away\\ntill that very day se'nnight.\"\\n\\nMr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\\nsaid only, coolly,\\n\\n\"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.\"\\n\\nAt another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much\\nastonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed\\nquite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\\n\\n\"We are sure of excellent fires,\" continued he, \"and every thing in the\\ngreatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--Mrs. Weston\\nindeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so\\nhospitable, and so fond of society;--it will be a small party, but where\\nsmall parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.\\nMr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably;\\nand for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by\\ntwo than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me, (turning with\\na soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,\\nthough Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of\\nLondon, may not quite enter into our feelings.\"\\n\\n\"I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine with\\nany body.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had\\nbeen so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will\\nbe paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great\\nenjoyment.\"\\n\\n\"My first enjoyment,\" replied John Knightley, as they passed through the\\nsweep-gate, \"will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nSome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they\\nwalked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose his\\njoyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr.\\nElton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the\\nplace.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as\\nhappy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.\\nMr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the\\nworld to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any\\none, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and\\nunderstood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the\\nlittle affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father\\nand herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\\nhad not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication\\nof all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life\\ndepends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\\n\\nThis was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not\\nafford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the\\nvery sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful\\nto Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr.\\nElton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that\\nwas enjoyable to the utmost.\\n\\nThe misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through\\nbefore her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough\\nto give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\\nIsabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just\\ngot to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\\ndaughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost\\nwholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and\\nwelcome her dear Emma.\\n\\nEmma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry\\nto find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her.\\nThe difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards\\nHarriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but\\nwas continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and\\nsolicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting\\nhim, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal\\nsuggestion of \"Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be\\npossible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from\\nHarriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!\"--Yet he would be so anxious\\nfor her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father,\\nand so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her\\ndrawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly\\nlike a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her\\ngood manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's,\\nin the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively\\ncivil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on\\namongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's\\nnonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard enough\\nto know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son; she\\nheard the words \"my son,\" and \"Frank,\" and \"my son,\" repeated several\\ntimes over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected\\nthat he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could\\nquiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving\\nquestion from her would have been awkward.\\n\\nNow, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never\\nmarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr.\\nFrank Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\\nthought--especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that\\nif she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\\ncharacter and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\\nfamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be\\na match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\\nWeston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though\\nnot meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\\nsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\\nchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention\\nof finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and\\na sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends'\\nimaginations.\\n\\nWith such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\\ncross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\\npass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\\nsubstance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--for\\nwhen happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,\\nat dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\\nhospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to\\nher,\\n\\n\"We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to see\\ntwo more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son--and\\nthen I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not hear me\\ntelling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank.\\nI had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us within a\\nfortnight.\"\\n\\nEmma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\\nhis proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party\\nquite complete.\\n\\n\"He has been wanting to come to us,\" continued Mr. Weston, \"ever since\\nSeptember: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\\nown time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\\nourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\\nBut now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\\nJanuary.\"\\n\\n\"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\\nanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\\nyourself.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\\nShe does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\\nknow the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is--(but this is\\nquite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other\\nroom. There are secrets in all families, you know)--The case is, that a\\nparty of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and\\nthat Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not\\nput off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a family\\nthat a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular\\ndislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in\\ntwo or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.\\nI have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing\\nFrank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself:\\nbut your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table)\\nhas so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at\\nHartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been\\nlong in the practice of doing.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,\" replied\\nEmma; \"but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he\\nwill come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at\\nthe place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself\\nto speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe her to be very\\nfond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of\\nany body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her\\nway--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing\\nto be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,\\nthat he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say\\nit to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in\\ngeneral; and the devil of a temper.\"\\n\\nEmma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\\nvery soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--yet\\nobserving, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--\\nMrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be\\nsecure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked\\nof: \"for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as\\nMr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.\\nWeston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\\nChurchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.\"\\n\\n\"My Emma!\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"what is the certainty\\nof caprice?\" Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending\\nbefore--\"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\\nso sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\\nthinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in\\nshort, upon her temper. To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on\\nthe truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\\nwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\" replied Isabella:\\n\"and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest\\ncompassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must\\nbe dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but\\nit must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she never had any\\nchildren! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!\"\\n\\nEmma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have\\nheard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\\nwhich she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills\\nfrom her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at\\npresent there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon\\nfollowed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after\\ndinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\\nconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\\nwhom he was always comfortable.\\n\\nWhile he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of\\nsaying,\\n\\n\"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\\ncertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,\\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\\nif this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\\nsome excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\\nany reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on\\nthe Churchills' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They\\nare jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\\ndependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.\"\\n\\n\"He ought to come,\" said Emma. \"If he could stay only a couple of days,\\nhe ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having\\nit in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall into\\nbad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wants\\nto be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_'s being under such\\nrestraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he\\nlikes it.\"\\n\\n\"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\\none decides upon what he can do,\" replied Mrs. Weston. \"One ought to\\nuse the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\\nindividual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\\nnot be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and every\\nthing gives way to her.\"\\n\\n\"But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. Now,\\naccording to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that\\nwhile she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she\\nowes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_,\\nshe should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes\\nnothing at all.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\\na bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.\\nI have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it\\nmay be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will\\nbe.\"\\n\\nEmma listened, and then coolly said, \"I shall not be satisfied, unless\\nhe comes.\"\\n\\n\"He may have a great deal of influence on some points,\" continued Mrs.\\nWeston, \"and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is\\nbeyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of\\nhis coming away from them to visit us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his\\ntea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\\ncompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of\\nthe hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty and\\nconvivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last\\nthe drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in very\\ngood spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and Emma\\nwere sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and, with\\nscarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\\n\\nEmma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by\\nthe expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\\nimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\\nmaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\\nfriendly smiles.\\n\\nHe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--her fair,\\nlovely, amiable friend. \"Did she know?--had she heard any thing about\\nher, since their being at Randalls?--he felt much anxiety--he must\\nconfess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.\"\\nAnd in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\\nattending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror\\nof a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\\n\\nBut at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he\\nwere more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than on\\nHarriet's--more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\\nthat there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\\nearnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\\nagain, for the present--to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\\ninto such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\\nthough she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its\\nproper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\\nabout her. She was vexed. It did appear--there was no concealing\\nit--exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\\nHarriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\\nand she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs. Weston\\nto implore her assistance, \"Would not she give him her support?--would\\nnot she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go\\nto Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had\\nno infection? He could not be satisfied without a promise--would not she\\ngive him her influence in procuring it?\"\\n\\n\"So scrupulous for others,\" he continued, \"and yet so careless for\\nherself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and\\nyet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\\nthroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us. Have not I\\nsome right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.\"\\n\\nEmma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\\naddress which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of\\nfirst interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked and\\noffended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.\\nShe could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she thought\\nmust restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a\\nseat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.\\n\\nShe had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did\\nanother subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room\\nfrom examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information\\nof the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing\\nfast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.\\nWoodhouse:\\n\\n\"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,\\nsir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way\\nthrough a storm of snow.\"\\n\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\\nhad something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\\nand had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston\\nand Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\\nson-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\\n\\n\"I admired your resolution very much, sir,\" said he, \"in venturing out\\nin such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.\\nEvery body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; and\\nI dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two's snow can\\nhardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is\\nblown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other\\nat hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.\"\\n\\nMr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest\\nit should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\\nhurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\\nto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid they\\nwould find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable, that\\nhe might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\\ngood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\\ncalling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\\nevery body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\\nconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.\\n\\n\"What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?\" was Mr.\\nWoodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say for some\\ntime. To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\\nrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\\ntheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\\n\\nHis eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\\nblocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full\\nin her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\\nadventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was eager\\nto have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls,\\nwhile she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible\\naccumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\\n\\n\"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,\" said she; \"I dare\\nsay we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if we\\ndo come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at all\\nafraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes,\\nyou know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that\\ngives me cold.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" replied he. \"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\\ndoes give you cold. Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home,\\nI dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.\"\\n\\nIsabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.\\nWeston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\\nnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;\\nand they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\\nleft the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow,\\ncame back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to examine,\\nand could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their\\ngetting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence. He\\nhad gone beyond the sweep--some way along the Highbury road--the snow\\nwas nowhere above half an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to\\nwhiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the\\nclouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon\\nover. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there\\nbeing nothing to apprehend.\\n\\nTo Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were\\nscarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who\\nwas immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\\nconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\\nappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\\nRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning\\nhome, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay; and\\nwhile the others were variously urging and recommending, Mr. Knightley\\nand Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus--\\n\\n\"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?\"\\n\\n\"I am ready, if the others are.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I ring the bell?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, do.\"\\n\\nAnd the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes more,\\nand Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own\\nhouse, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and\\nhappiness when this visit of hardship were over.\\n\\nThe carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such\\noccasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.\\nWeston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal\\nof alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the\\ndiscovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. \"He was\\nafraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella\\nwould not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.\\nHe did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together\\nas they could;\" and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very\\nslow and wait for the other carriage.\\n\\nIsabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\\ndid not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\\nso that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\\ncarriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\\nand that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. It would not have been\\nthe awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to\\nhim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but\\none. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had\\nbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he\\nwould want to be talking nonsense.\\n\\nTo restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of\\nthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had they\\npassed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she found her\\nsubject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded, and Mr. Elton\\nactually making violent love to her: availing himself of the precious\\nopportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known,\\nhoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him; but\\nflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\\nunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\\nvery much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\\nreally was so. Without scruple--without apology--without much apparent\\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\\n_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\\nit all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\\nrestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\\nbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\\nthe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\\nplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\\nreplied,\\n\\n\"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\\nyourself--you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall\\nbe happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly\\nmean!\"--And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such\\nboastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with\\nquickness,\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\\nto say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\"\\n\\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at\\nall to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\\nhaving warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\\nslightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--but\\nacknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--he\\nresumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\\nfavourable answer.\\n\\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\\ninconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\\nreplied,\\n\\n\"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\\ntoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\\nexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\\nmonth, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the daily\\nhabit of observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this is an\\nunsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!\\nBelieve me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object\\nof such professions.\"\\n\\n\"Good Heaven!\" cried Mr. Elton, \"what can be the meaning of this?--Miss\\nSmith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\\nexistence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she\\nhas fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\\nsorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse!\\nwho can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\\nhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\\nyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\\nelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\\nbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You\\ncannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!--(in an accent meant to be\\ninsinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me.\"\\n\\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--which\\nof all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely\\noverpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence\\nbeing ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he\\ntried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed--\\n\\n\"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting\\nsilence. It confesses that you have long understood me.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" cried Emma, \"it confesses no such thing. So far from having\\nlong understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\\nto your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\\nshould have been giving way to any feelings--Nothing could be farther\\nfrom my wishes--your attachment to my friend Harriet--your pursuit of\\nher, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\\nvery earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not\\nyour attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged\\nill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you have\\nnever sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you\\nhave never thought seriously of her?\"\\n\\n\"Never, madam,\" cried he, affronted in his turn: \"never, I assure you.\\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort of\\ngirl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish\\nher extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\\nto--Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\\nalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--No, madam, my\\nvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I\\nreceived--\"\\n\\n\"Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely\\nmistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\\nfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\\nacquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\\nends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\\nhave been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\\nprobably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\\nare so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\\ntrust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.\"\\n\\nHe was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite\\nsupplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually\\ndeep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,\\nfor the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If\\nthere had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate\\nawkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the\\nlittle zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage\\nturned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,\\nall at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another\\nsyllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good\\nnight. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under\\nindescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to Hartfield.\\n\\nThere she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who\\nhad been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage\\nLane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--and in\\nstrange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it seemed as\\nif her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.\\nJohn Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and\\nattention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her\\nfather, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin of\\ngruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the\\nday was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\\nexcept herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and\\nit needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the\\nusual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nThe hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\\nand be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow\\nof every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every\\nthing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst\\nof all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\\nother; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and\\nshe would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--more in\\nerror--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the\\neffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\\n\\n\"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have\\nborne any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me--but poor\\nHarriet!\"\\n\\nHow she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never\\nthought seriously of Harriet--never! She looked back as well as\\nshe could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\\nsupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\\nhave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\\nmisled.\\n\\nThe picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--and the\\ncharade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--how clearly they had\\nseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its \"ready\\nwit\"--but then the \"soft eyes\"--in fact it suited neither; it was\\na jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such\\nthick-headed nonsense?\\n\\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\\nherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere\\nerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others\\nthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\\ngentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\\ntill this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\\nany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.\\n\\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\\nsubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\\nthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\\nhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given,\\nthe conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\\nindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\\ncharacter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It\\nwas dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\\nrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\\nproud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\\nconcerned about the feelings of others.\\n\\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his\\naddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\\nproposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\\nand was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\\narrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was\\nperfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be\\ncared for. There had been no real affection either in his language or\\nmanners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could\\nhardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less\\nallied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him. He\\nonly wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\\neasily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\\nelse with twenty, or with ten.\\n\\nBut--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\\nof his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\\nhim!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!--look down\\nupon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\\nhim, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\\npresumption in addressing her!--It was most provoking.\\n\\nPerhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\\ninferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\\nsuch equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\\nin fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must\\nknow that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\\nHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family--and that the\\nEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was\\ninconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\\nto which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\\nother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\\nAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had\\nlong held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which\\nMr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as he\\ncould, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend him\\nto notice but his situation and his civility.--But he had fancied her\\nin love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\\nafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\\nand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop\\nand admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\\nobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\\nmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and\\ndelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\\nIf _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\\nwonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\\nhers.\\n\\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\\nwrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\\nwas adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what\\nought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite\\nconcerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\\n\\n\"Here have I,\" said she, \"actually talked poor Harriet into being very\\nmuch attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\\nme; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\\nnot assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\\nused to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not\\nto accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done\\nof me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\\nchance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\\nopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\\nattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\\nI have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel this\\ndisappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body\\nelse who would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I\\ncould not endure William Coxe--a pert young lawyer.\"\\n\\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a more\\nserious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be,\\nand must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet, and\\nall that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of\\nfuture meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the\\nacquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding\\neclat, were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some\\ntime longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the\\nconviction of her having blundered most dreadfully.\\n\\nTo youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under temporary\\ngloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of\\nspirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,\\nand of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough\\nto keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of\\nsoftened pain and brighter hope.\\n\\nEmma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone\\nto bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to\\ndepend on getting tolerably out of it.\\n\\nIt was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in\\nlove with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to\\ndisappoint him--that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior\\nsort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--and that there\\ncould be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the\\nthree principals, and especially for her father's being given a moment's\\nuneasiness about it.\\n\\nThese were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow\\non the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome that\\nmight justify their all three being quite asunder at present.\\n\\nThe weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she\\ncould not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his\\ndaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting\\nor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered\\nwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and\\nthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every\\nmorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to\\nfreeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No intercourse\\nwith Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on Sunday any\\nmore than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's\\nabsenting himself.\\n\\nIt was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though\\nshe hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society\\nor other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with\\nhis being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir out; and to\\nhear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from\\nthem,--\\n\\n\"Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?\"\\n\\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\\nher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to\\nhis companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his\\nill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during the\\nrest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and obliging,\\nand speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes of\\ncheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such\\nan evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as\\nmade it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The\\nweather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.\\nWoodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay\\nbehind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party\\nset off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor\\nIsabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doated\\non, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently\\nbusy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.\\n\\nThe evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.\\nElton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with\\nMr. Elton's best compliments, \"that he was proposing to leave Highbury\\nthe following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with\\nthe pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few\\nweeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from\\nvarious circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal\\nleave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever\\nretain a grateful sense--and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be\\nhappy to attend to them.\"\\n\\nEmma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just at this\\ntime was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contriving\\nit, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it\\nwas announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than\\nin a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.\\nShe had not even a share in his opening compliments.--Her name was not\\nmentioned;--and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an\\nill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments, as\\nshe thought, at first, could not escape her father's suspicion.\\n\\nIt did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so\\nsudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to\\nthe end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was a\\nvery useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought\\nand conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse\\ntalked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away\\nwith all her usual promptitude.\\n\\nShe now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reason\\nto believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that\\nshe should have as much time as possible for getting the better of\\nher other complaint before the gentleman's return. She went to Mrs.\\nGoddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary\\npenance of communication; and a severe one it was.--She had to destroy\\nall the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding--to appear in\\nthe ungracious character of the one preferred--and acknowledge herself\\ngrossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all\\nher observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last\\nsix weeks.\\n\\nThe confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight of\\nHarriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with\\nherself again.\\n\\nHarriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--and in every\\nthing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion\\nof herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to\\nher friend.\\n\\nEmma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;\\nand all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on\\nHarriet's side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as having\\nany thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton\\nwould have been too great a distinction.--She never could have deserved\\nhim--and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would\\nhave thought it possible.\\n\\nHer tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless, that\\nno dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes--and\\nshe listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and\\nunderstanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was the\\nsuperior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would be more for\\nher own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could\\ndo.\\n\\nIt was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and\\nignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of\\nbeing humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of\\nher life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father's claims, was\\nto promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her own affection\\nin some better method than by match-making. She got her to Hartfield,\\nand shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and\\namuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her\\nthoughts.\\n\\nTime, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and\\nshe could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in\\ngeneral, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton\\nin particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age,\\nand with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be\\nmade towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as\\nto allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,\\nwithout any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.\\n\\nHarriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence\\nof any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth,\\nprove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet\\nit appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an\\ninclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend its\\ncontinuing very long in equal force.\\n\\nIf Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and\\nindubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not\\nimagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the\\nrecollection of him.\\n\\nTheir being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for\\neach, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of\\neffecting any material change of society. They must encounter each\\nother, and make the best of it.\\n\\nHarriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.\\nGoddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great\\ngirls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could\\nhave any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or\\nrepellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be\\nfound if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of\\ncure, there could be no true peace for herself.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs.\\nWeston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For\\nthe present, he could not be spared, to his \"very great mortification\\nand regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to\\nRandalls at no distant period.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed, in\\nfact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man\\nhad been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever\\nexpecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by\\nany proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,\\nand begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and\\nsorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three\\nmonths later would be a much better plan; better time of year;\\nbetter weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay\\nconsiderably longer with them than if he had come sooner.\\n\\nThese feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of\\na more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of\\nexcuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was\\nto suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.\\n\\nEmma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr.\\nFrank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls.\\nThe acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted, rather, to\\nbe quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she\\nshould appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to express\\nas much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr.\\nand Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to their\\nfriendship.\\n\\nShe was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite\\nas much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather\\nmore,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then\\nproceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of\\nsuch an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of\\nlooking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the\\nsight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the\\nChurchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement\\nwith Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was\\ntaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\\nuse of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.\\n\\n\"The Churchills are very likely in fault,\" said Mr. Knightley, coolly;\\n\"but I dare say he might come if he would.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; but\\nhis uncle and aunt will not spare him.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a\\npoint of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.\"\\n\\n\"How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose\\nhim such an unnatural creature?\"\\n\\n\"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that\\nhe may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little\\nfor any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have\\nalways set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural than\\none could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud,\\nluxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too. If\\nFrank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it\\nbetween September and January. A man at his age--what is he?--three or\\nfour-and-twenty--cannot be without the means of doing as much as that.\\nIt is impossible.\"\\n\\n\"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\\nown master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\\ndifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\\nto manage.\"\\n\\n\"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\\nmoney--he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\\nmuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in\\nthe kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other. A\\nlittle while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can leave the\\nChurchills.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sometimes he can.\"\\n\\n\"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\\nthere is any temptation of pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate\\nknowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\\nof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that\\nfamily may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\\nChurchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\\ncan do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at\\nothers.\"\\n\\n\"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\\nthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\\nresolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his\\nfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\\nwished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\\nonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill--'Every sacrifice of\\nmere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience;\\nbut I must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by\\nmy failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion.\\nI shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'--If he would say so to her\\nat once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\\nopposition made to his going.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Emma, laughing; \"but perhaps there might be some made to his\\ncoming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\\nuse!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\\nhave not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to\\nyour own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\\nthe uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\\nhim!--Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\\nloud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it. He\\nwould feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made, of course,\\nas a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--would do him more\\ngood, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the people he\\ndepended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do.\\nRespect would be added to affection. They would feel that they could\\ntrust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father, would do\\nrightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as well as all the\\nworld must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his father; and\\nwhile meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their hearts not\\nthinking the better of him for submitting to their whims. Respect for\\nright conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in this sort of\\nmanner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would\\nbend to his.\"\\n\\n\"I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\\nwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have\\na knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great\\nones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were to be\\ntransported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's situation,\\nyou would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for\\nhim; and it might have a very good effect. The Churchills might not have\\na word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of early\\nobedience and long observance to break through. To him who has, it might\\nnot be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set\\nall their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as\\nstrong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so\\nequal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it.\"\\n\\n\"Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\\nexertion, it could not be an equal conviction.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\\nunderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly\\nopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the\\nwill of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of\\nfollowing his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for\\nthe fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he\\nought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\\ntheir authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their\\nside to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there\\nwould have been no difficulty now.\"\\n\\n\"We shall never agree about him,\" cried Emma; \"but that is nothing\\nextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\\nI feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,\\nthough in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,\\ncomplying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's\\nperfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some\\nadvantages, it will secure him many others.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and\\nof leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely\\nexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine\\nflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade\\nhimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of\\npreserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any right to\\ncomplain. His letters disgust me.\"\\n\\n\"Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.\"\\n\\n\"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy\\na woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's\\nplace, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on her\\naccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly\\nfeel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\\nwould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether\\nhe did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\\nconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to\\nherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in French,\\nnot in English. He may be very 'amiable,' have very good manners, and be\\nvery agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings\\nof other people: nothing really amiable about him.\"\\n\\n\"You seem determined to think ill of him.\"\\n\\n\"Me!--not at all,\" replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; \"I do not\\nwant to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits\\nas any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely personal;\\nthat he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible manners.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure\\nat Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and\\nagreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the\\nbargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\\ncoming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the\\nparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--one object of\\ncuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak\\nof nobody else.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\\nconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\\nchattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.\"\\n\\n\"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\\nevery body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\\nagreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;\\nand so on to every body, having that general information on all subjects\\nwhich will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead, just as\\npropriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each; that is my\\nidea of him.\"\\n\\n\"And mine,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"is, that if he turn out any\\nthing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\\nat three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--the\\npractised politician, who is to read every body's character, and make\\nevery body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to\\nbe dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like\\nfools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could not\\nendure such a puppy when it came to the point.\"\\n\\n\"I will say no more about him,\" cried Emma, \"you turn every thing to\\nevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\\nchance of agreeing till he is really here.\"\\n\\n\"Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.\"\\n\\n\"But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love for\\nMr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.\"\\n\\n\"He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,\" said\\nMr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately\\ntalk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should be\\nangry.\\n\\nTo take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a\\ndifferent disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of\\nmind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the\\nhigh opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she had\\nnever before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit\\nof another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVOLUME II\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nEmma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma's\\nopinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could\\nnot think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more; and\\nshe was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they\\nreturned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,\\nand after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and\\nreceiving no other answer than a very plaintive--\"Mr. Elton is so good\\nto the poor!\" she found something else must be done.\\n\\nThey were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.\\nShe determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was\\nalways sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates\\nloved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few\\nwho presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in\\nthat respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of\\ntheir scanty comforts.\\n\\nShe had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\\nas to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion\\nof its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--and\\nall the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and\\nthird-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore\\nshe seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden resolution of not\\npassing their door without going in--observing, as she proposed it to\\nHarriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quite\\nsafe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.\\n\\nThe house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied\\nthe drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,\\nwhich was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even\\ngratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was\\nseated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to\\nMiss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, almost ready\\nto overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit,\\nsolicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse's\\nhealth, cheerful communications about her mother's, and sweet-cake from\\nthe beaufet--\"Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called in for ten\\nminutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and _she_ had\\ntaken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much;\\nand, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them\\nthe favour to eat a piece too.\"\\n\\nThe mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.\\nThere was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton\\nsince his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the\\nletter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much\\nhe was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went,\\nand how full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been; and she went\\nthrough it very well, with all the interest and all the commendation\\nthat could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriet's\\nbeing obliged to say a word.\\n\\nThis she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant,\\nhaving once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by\\nany troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses\\nand Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not been\\nprepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was actually\\nhurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last abruptly to\\nthe Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--Mrs. Cole\\nwas telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--Mrs. Cole was so\\nkind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as\\nshe came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a\\nfavourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to\\nshew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much\\nas any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying,\\n'I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her\\ntime for writing;' and when I immediately said, 'But indeed we have, we\\nhad a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body\\nmore surprized. 'Have you, upon your honour?' said she; 'well, that is\\nquite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.'\"\\n\\nEmma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--\\n\\n\"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I\\nhope she is well?\"\\n\\n\"Thank you. You are so kind!\" replied the happily deceived aunt, while\\neagerly hunting for the letter.--\"Oh! here it is. I was sure it could\\nnot be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being\\naware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately\\nthat I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs.\\nCole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for\\nit is such a pleasure to her--a letter from Jane--that she can never\\nhear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is,\\nonly just under my huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear\\nwhat she says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to\\nJane, apologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you\\nsee--hardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses\\nhalf. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She often\\nsays, when the letter is first opened, 'Well, Hetty, now I think\\nyou will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--don't you,\\nma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it out\\nherself, if she had nobody to do it for her--every word of it--I am sure\\nshe would pore over it till she had made out every word. And, indeed,\\nthough my mother's eyes are not so good as they were, she can see\\namazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is such\\na blessing! My mother's are really very good indeed. Jane often says,\\nwhen she is here, 'I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong\\neyes to see as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I\\nonly wish my eyes may last me as well.'\"\\n\\nAll this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;\\nand Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\\nFairfax's handwriting.\\n\\n\"You are extremely kind,\" replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; \"you who\\nare such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure there is\\nnobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's.\\nMy mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know. Ma'am,\"\\naddressing her, \"do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say\\nabout Jane's handwriting?\"\\n\\nAnd Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated\\ntwice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She was\\npondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very\\nrude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had almost\\nresolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss\\nBates turned to her again and seized her attention.\\n\\n\"My mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all. By\\nonly raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\\nshe is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very\\nremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\\nJane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at all\\ndeafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my\\nmother's time of life--and it really is full two years, you know, since\\nshe was here. We never were so long without seeing her before, and as\\nI was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes; next week.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so\\nsurprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she\\nwill be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see\\nher. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel\\nCampbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So very\\ngood of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you know. Oh\\nyes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about. That is\\nthe reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in the\\ncommon course, we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or\\nWednesday.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my\\nhearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.\"\\n\\n\"So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been\\nfor this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My\\nmother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us at\\nleast. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the\\npleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells are\\ngoing to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come\\nover and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till the\\nsummer, but she is so impatient to see them again--for till she married,\\nlast October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must\\nmake it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,\\nbut however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter\\nto her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but\\nwe shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon's name as\\nwell as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would\\ngive them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country\\nseat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great\\ndeal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--I do not know that she ever\\nheard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know,\\nthat he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his\\naddresses--and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them--for\\nColonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter's\\nnot walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all\\nblame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss\\nCampbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word\\nthat he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had\\ntaken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane\\nwas quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things.\"\\n\\nAt this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's\\nbrain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the\\nnot going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther\\ndiscovery,\\n\\n\"You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to\\ncome to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship\\nbetween her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be\\nexcused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been\\nrather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a\\ndistance from us, for months together--not able to come if any thing was\\nto happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want\\nher (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.\\nCampbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing\\nthan their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;\\nMr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is\\na most charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at\\nWeymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by the\\nsudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have\\nbeen dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he\\nhad not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--\\n(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we had the\\nhistory of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!\"\\n\\n\"But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish of seeing\\nIreland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel\\nand Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should\\nrecommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native\\nair, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.\"\\n\\n\"I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.\\nDixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has\\nno remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be\\ncompared with Miss Fairfax.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.\\nThere is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was absolutely\\nplain--but extremely elegant and amiable.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that of course.\"\\n\\n\"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November,\\n(as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. A long\\ntime, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never mentioned\\nit before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so\\nconsiderate!--But however, she is so far from well, that her kind\\nfriends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air\\nthat always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four\\nmonths at Highbury will entirely cure her--and it is certainly a great\\ndeal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is\\nunwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.\"\\n\\n\"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.\"\\n\\n\"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells\\nleave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--as you will\\nfind from Jane's letter. So sudden!--You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhat a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of\\nher illness--but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and\\nlooking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to\\nme, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through\\nto myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for\\nfear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me\\nto do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;\\nbut no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I\\nburst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'--which\\nmy mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed\\nat. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had\\nfancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does\\nnot think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my\\nguard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The\\nexpense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so\\nfond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for\\nattendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and\\nfamily to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I\\nhave just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to\\nher letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better\\nthan I can tell it for her.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid we must be running away,\" said Emma, glancing at Harriet,\\nand beginning to rise--\"My father will be expecting us. I had no\\nintention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,\\nwhen I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not\\npass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so\\npleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good\\nmorning.\"\\n\\nAnd not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regained\\nthe street--happy in this, that though much had been forced on her\\nagainst her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of\\nJane Fairfax's letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nJane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest\\ndaughter.\\n\\nThe marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ----regiment of infantry,\\nand Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope\\nand interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy\\nremembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking under\\nconsumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.\\n\\nBy birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on\\nlosing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the consolation,\\nthe foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every\\nprobability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taught\\nonly what very limited means could command, and growing up with no\\nadvantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what\\nnature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and\\nwarm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\\n\\nBut the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change\\nto her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded\\nFairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and\\nfarther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe\\ncamp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims which\\nhe did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the\\ndeath of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing in\\nhis power. When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice\\nof her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about\\nJane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and\\ngrowing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old, his\\ndaughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real\\nfriend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking\\nthe whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and from that period\\nJane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them\\nentirely, only visiting her grandmother from time to time.\\n\\nThe plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the\\nvery few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making\\nindependence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel\\nCampbell's power; for though his income, by pay and appointments, was\\nhandsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter's;\\nbut, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supplying the means of\\nrespectable subsistence hereafter.\\n\\nSuch was Jane Fairfax's history. She had fallen into good hands, known\\nnothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent\\neducation. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people,\\nher heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline\\nand culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every\\nlighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of\\nfirst-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy\\nof all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was,\\nas far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,\\nfully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too\\nmuch beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could promote,\\nand the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. It was\\neasy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane remained with\\nthem, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of\\nan elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with\\nonly the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own\\ngood understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.\\n\\nThe affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss\\nCampbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from\\nthe circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and\\nacquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen\\nby the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the\\nparents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till the\\nmarriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often\\ndefies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is\\nmoderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of\\nMr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were\\nacquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had\\nyet her bread to earn.\\n\\nThis event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\\nyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\\nof duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had\\nfixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\\nshould be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she had\\nresolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from\\nall the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace\\nand hope, to penance and mortification for ever.\\n\\nThe good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such\\na resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no\\nexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for\\ntheir own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this would\\nbe selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps they\\nbegan to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the\\ntemptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments\\nof ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however,\\naffection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying\\non the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since the time of\\ntheir daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recovered\\nher usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so\\nfar from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits,\\nseemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something\\nmore than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with\\ntolerable comfort.\\n\\nWith regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her\\naunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths\\nnot told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to\\nHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with\\nthose kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\\nwhatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or\\ntreble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they\\ndepended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery\\nof her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she was to\\ncome; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which\\nhad been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for the\\npresent with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two\\nyears' absence.\\n\\nEmma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like\\nthrough three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished,\\nand less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\\ndifficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was\\nbecause she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she\\nwanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly\\nrefuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which\\nher conscience could not quite acquit her. But \"she could never get\\nacquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such\\ncoldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she pleased or\\nnot--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made\\nsuch a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that\\nthey were to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every\\nbody had supposed they must be so fond of each other.\" These were her\\nreasons--she had no better.\\n\\nIt was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified\\nby fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\\nconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\\nnow, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'\\ninterval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\\nmanners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating. Jane\\nFairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself the\\nhighest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as almost\\nevery body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her\\nfigure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between\\nfat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point\\nout the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and\\nthen, her face--her features--there was more beauty in them altogether\\nthan she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing\\nbeauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had\\nnever been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to\\ncavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really\\nneeded no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was\\nthe reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her\\nprinciples, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind,\\nshe saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction,\\nand merit.\\n\\nIn short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with\\ntwofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering\\njustice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When\\nshe took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;\\nwhen she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she was\\ngoing to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible\\nto feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every\\nwell-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly\\nprobable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had\\nso naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more\\npitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\\nEmma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's\\nactions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination\\nhad suggested at first. If it were love, it might be simple, single,\\nsuccessless love on her side alone. She might have been unconsciously\\nsucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her\\nfriend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be\\ndenying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself\\neffectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of\\nlaborious duty.\\n\\nUpon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\\nas made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she\\ncould wish to scheme about for her.\\n\\nThese were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she had committed\\nherself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax,\\nor done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than\\nsaying to Mr. Knightley, \"She certainly is handsome; she is better than\\nhandsome!\" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother\\nand aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state.\\nFormer provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more\\ntiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration\\nof her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how\\nlittle bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice\\nof mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new\\nworkbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.\\nThey had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise\\nwhich necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an\\nair of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very\\nsuperior performance. She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so\\ncold, so cautious! There was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in\\na cloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She was\\ndisgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.\\n\\nIf any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on\\nthe subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed bent\\non giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own value\\nfor his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all\\ngeneral approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.\\nIt did her no service however. Her caution was thrown away. Emma saw\\nits artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There probably _was_\\nsomething more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps,\\nhad been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only\\nto Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.\\n\\nThe like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill\\nhad been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a\\nlittle acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\\nprocure as to what he truly was. \"Was he handsome?\"--\"She believed\\nhe was reckoned a very fine young man.\" \"Was he agreeable?\"--\"He was\\ngenerally thought so.\" \"Did he appear a sensible young man; a young\\nman of information?\"--\"At a watering-place, or in a common London\\nacquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were\\nall that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\\nthey had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his\\nmanners pleasing.\" Emma could not forgive her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nEmma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment\\nwere discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was\\nexpressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with\\nMr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might\\nhave done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough\\nto be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her unjust to\\nJane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.\\n\\n\"A very pleasant evening,\" he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been\\ntalked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers\\nswept away;--\"particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some\\nvery good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting\\nat one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women;\\nsometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss\\nFairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing\\nundone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument\\nat her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence.\"\\n\\n\"I am happy you approved,\" said Emma, smiling; \"but I hope I am not\\noften deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear,\" said her father instantly; \"_that_ I am sure you are not.\\nThere is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing,\\nyou are too attentive. The muffin last night--if it had been handed\\nround once, I think it would have been enough.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; \"you are not often\\ndeficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I\\nthink you understand me, therefore.\"\\n\\nAn arch look expressed--\"I understand you well enough;\" but she said\\nonly, \"Miss Fairfax is reserved.\"\\n\\n\"I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome all\\nthat part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its\\nfoundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured.\"\\n\\n\"You think her diffident. I do not see it.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Emma,\" said he, moving from his chair into one close by her,\\n\"you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant\\nevening.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and\\namused to think how little information I obtained.\"\\n\\n\"I am disappointed,\" was his only answer.\\n\\n\"I hope every body had a pleasant evening,\" said Mr. Woodhouse, in his\\nquiet way. \"I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I\\nmoved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.\\nMiss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though\\nshe speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs.\\nBates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane\\nFairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a\\nvery well-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening\\nagreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.\"\\n\\n\"True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.\"\\n\\nEmma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the\\npresent, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--\\n\\n\"She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from.\\nI am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to\\nexpress; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose\\nthoughts were on the Bates's, said--\\n\\n\"It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a\\ngreat pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one can\\nventure to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--Now we\\nhave killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;\\nit is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is not like any other\\npork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure\\nof their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, without\\nthe smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roast\\npork--I think we had better send the leg--do not you think so, my dear?\"\\n\\n\"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\\nThere will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and\\nthe loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.\"\\n\\n\"That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but\\nthat is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it\\nis not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle\\nboils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a\\nlittle carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.\"\\n\\n\"Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley presently, \"I have a piece of news for you.\\nYou like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will\\ninterest you.\"\\n\\n\"News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?--why do you smile\\nso?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?\"\\n\\nHe had time only to say,\\n\\n\"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,\" when the door was\\nthrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full\\nof thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest.\\nMr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that not another\\nsyllable of communication could rest with him.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse--I\\ncome quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You\\nare too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be\\nmarried.\"\\n\\nEmma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so\\ncompletely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a\\nlittle blush, at the sound.\\n\\n\"There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,\" said Mr.\\nKnightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what\\nhad passed between them.\\n\\n\"But where could _you_ hear it?\" cried Miss Bates. \"Where could you\\npossibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I\\nreceived Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--or at least\\nten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out--I\\nwas only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork--Jane was\\nstanding in the passage--were not you, Jane?--for my mother was so\\nafraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would\\ngo down and see, and Jane said, 'Shall I go down instead? for I think\\nyou have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--'Oh!\\nmy dear,' said I--well, and just then came the note. A Miss\\nHawkins--that's all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley,\\nhow could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told\\nMrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins--\"\\n\\n\"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just\\nread Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.\"\\n\\n\"Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more\\ngenerally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My\\nmother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand\\nthanks, and says you really quite oppress her.\"\\n\\n\"We consider our Hartfield pork,\" replied Mr. Woodhouse--\"indeed it\\ncertainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I cannot\\nhave a greater pleasure than--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good\\nto us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\\nthemselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.\\nWe may well say that 'our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.' Well, Mr.\\nKnightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--\"\\n\\n\"It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course.\"--\\nHere was a sly glance at Emma. \"He had been so fortunate as to--I forget\\nthe precise words--one has no business to remember them. The information\\nwas, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins. By\\nhis style, I should imagine it just settled.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton going to be married!\" said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\\n\"He will have every body's wishes for his happiness.\"\\n\\n\"He is very young to settle,\" was Mr. Woodhouse's observation. \"He had\\nbetter not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. We\\nwere always glad to see him at Hartfield.\"\\n\\n\"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!\" said Miss Bates, joyfully;\\n\"my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot bear to have the poor old\\nVicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed. Jane, you have\\nnever seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see\\nhim.\"\\n\\nJane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to\\noccupy her.\\n\\n\"No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,\" she replied, starting on this appeal;\\n\"is he--is he a tall man?\"\\n\\n\"Who shall answer that question?\" cried Emma. \"My father would say\\n'yes,' Mr. Knightley 'no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the\\nhappy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,\\nyou will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in\\nHighbury, both in person and mind.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young\\nman--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he\\nwas precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,--I dare say, an\\nexcellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother--wanting\\nher to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my\\nmother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she does not\\nhear quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He\\nfancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--but she says it did\\nhim no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel.\\nAnd Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. It\\nis such a happiness when good people get together--and they always do.\\nNow, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles,\\nsuch very good people; and the Perrys--I suppose there never was a\\nhappier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,\" turning\\nto Mr. Woodhouse, \"I think there are few places with such society as\\nHighbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear\\nsir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is\\npork--a roast loin of pork--\"\\n\\n\"As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted\\nwith her,\" said Emma, \"nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that it\\ncannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four weeks.\"\\n\\nNobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\\nEmma said,\\n\\n\"You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take an interest\\nin this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late\\non these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss\\nCampbell's account--we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr.\\nElton and Miss Hawkins.\"\\n\\n\"When I have seen Mr. Elton,\" replied Jane, \"I dare say I shall be\\ninterested--but I believe it requires _that_ with me. And as it is some\\nmonths since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn\\noff.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,\"\\nsaid Miss Bates, \"four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had\\nalways rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not that\\nI ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said, 'No, Mr.\\nElton is a most worthy young man--but'--In short, I do not think I am\\nparticularly quick at those sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it.\\nWhat is before me, I see. At the same time, nobody could wonder if\\nMr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so\\ngood-humouredly. She knows I would not offend for the world. How does\\nMiss Smith do? She seems quite recovered now. Have you heard from Mrs.\\nJohn Knightley lately? Oh! those dear little children. Jane, do you\\nknow I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean in\\nperson--tall, and with that sort of look--and not very talkative.\"\\n\\n\"Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.\"\\n\\n\"Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\\nOne takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is\\nnot, strictly speaking, handsome?\"\\n\\n\"Handsome! Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain. I told you he was\\nplain.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\\nand that you yourself--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard,\\nI always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the\\ngeneral opinion, when I called him plain.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather does\\nnot look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my\\ndear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most\\nagreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's;\\nbut I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home\\ndirectly--I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is the\\nbetter for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not\\nattempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares for\\nany thing but _boiled_ pork: when we dress the leg it will be another\\nthing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming\\ntoo. Well, that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be\\nso kind as to give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good\\nmorning to you.\"\\n\\nEmma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while\\nhe lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--and to\\nmarry strangers too--and the other half she could give to her own view\\nof the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece\\nof news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but she\\nwas sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it--and all that she could hope\\nwas, by giving the first information herself, to save her from hearing\\nit abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she was likely\\nto call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its\\nbeginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would\\nbe detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would\\nundoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.\\n\\nThe shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,\\nwhen in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which\\nhurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the \"Oh! Miss\\nWoodhouse, what do you think has happened!\" which instantly burst forth,\\nhad all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow was\\ngiven, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in\\nlistening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had to\\ntell. \"She had set out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago--she had\\nbeen afraid it would rain--she had been afraid it would pour down\\nevery moment--but she thought she might get to Hartfield first--she\\nhad hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the\\nhouse where a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she\\nwould just step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem\\nto stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,\\nand she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as\\nshe could, and took shelter at Ford's.\"--Ford's was the principal\\nwoollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the shop\\nfirst in size and fashion in the place.--\"And so, there she had\\nset, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes,\\nperhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--to be sure it was\\nso very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's--who should come in, but\\nElizabeth Martin and her brother!--Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I\\nthought I should have fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting\\nnear the door--Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy\\nwith the umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly,\\nand took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the\\nshop; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!\\nI am sure I must have been as white as my gown. I could not go away\\nyou know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the\\nworld but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last, I fancy, he\\nlooked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they\\nbegan whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and\\nI could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do\\nyou think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came\\nquite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,\\nif I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she used; I\\ncould see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be very\\nfriendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no\\nmore what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she\\nwas sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss\\nWoodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to\\nhold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting\\naway--and then--only think!--I found he was coming up towards me\\ntoo--slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and\\nso he came and spoke, and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling\\ndreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and\\nsaid it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got\\nthree yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was\\ngoing to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's\\nstables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh!\\ndear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was\\nvery much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and then he went\\nback to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables--I believe I did--but\\nI hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\\nI would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know,\\nthere was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and\\nso kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and\\nmake me comfortable again.\"\\n\\nVery sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in\\nher power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly\\ncomfortable herself. The young man's conduct, and his sister's, seemed\\nthe result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet\\ndescribed it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection\\nand genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed them to be\\nwell-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make\\nin the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed by it. Of\\ncourse, he must be sorry to lose her--they must be all sorry. Ambition,\\nas well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all have hoped\\nto rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of\\nHarriet's description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--what\\nsignified her praise?\\n\\nShe exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering\\nall that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt\\non,\\n\\n\"It might be distressing, for the moment,\" said she; \"but you seem to\\nhave behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--can never,\\nas a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about\\nit.\"\\n\\nHarriet said, \"very true,\" and she \"would not think about it;\" but still\\nshe talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at\\nlast, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurry\\non the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution;\\nhardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only\\namused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of\\nMr. Elton's importance with her!\\n\\nMr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feel\\nthe first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an hour\\nbefore, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation\\nwas over, she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity,\\nwonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins,\\nwhich could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in\\nher fancy.\\n\\nEmma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It\\nhad been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any\\ninfluence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get\\nat her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the\\ncourage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the\\nbrother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's; and a twelvemonth\\nmight pass without their being thrown together again, with any\\nnecessity, or even any power of speech.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nHuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting\\nsituations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of\\nbeing kindly spoken of.\\n\\nA week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned in\\nHighbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have\\nevery recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly\\naccomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrived\\nto triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her merits,\\nthere was very little more for him to do, than to tell her Christian\\nname, and say whose music she principally played.\\n\\nMr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected and\\nmortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what\\nappeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right\\nlady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He\\nhad gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged to another--and\\nto another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such\\ncircumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came back gay\\nand self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse,\\nand defying Miss Smith.\\n\\nThe charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of\\nperfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,\\nof so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some\\ndignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had not\\nthrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts;\\nand he had gained her with such delightful rapidity--the first hour of\\nintroduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice;\\nthe history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress\\nof the affair was so glorious--the steps so quick, from the accidental\\nrencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's, and the party at Mrs.\\nBrown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance--with consciousness and\\nagitation richly scattered--the lady had been so easily impressed--so\\nsweetly disposed--had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase,\\nbeen so very ready to have him, that vanity and prudence were equally\\ncontented.\\n\\nHe had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection, and\\nwas just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and\\nhis own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be laughed\\nat--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young\\nladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more\\ncautiously gallant.\\n\\nThe wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to\\nplease, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and\\nwhen he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which\\na certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that when he\\nnext entered Highbury he would bring his bride.\\n\\nDuring his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just enough\\nto feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the impression\\nof his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, now\\nspread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning very much to wonder\\nthat she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his sight was so\\ninseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings, that,\\nexcept in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable\\nhumiliation to her own mind, she would have been thankful to be assured\\nof never seeing him again. She wished him very well; but he gave\\nher pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most\\nsatisfaction.\\n\\nThe pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must\\ncertainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be\\nprevented--many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would\\nbe an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink\\nwithout remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility\\nagain.\\n\\nOf the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good enough\\nfor Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--handsome\\nenough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As to connexion,\\nthere Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his own vaunted\\nclaims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On that article,\\ntruth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be uncertain; but _who_\\nshe was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not\\nappear that she was at all Harriet's superior. She brought no name, no\\nblood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters\\nof a Bristol--merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole\\nof the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it\\nwas not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very\\nmoderate also. Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath;\\nbut Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the\\nfather and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--in the law\\nline--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him, than\\nthat he was in the law line; and with him the daughter had lived. Emma\\nguessed him to be the drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise.\\nAnd all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder\\nsister, who was _very_ _well_ _married_, to a gentleman in a _great_\\n_way_, near Bristol, who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the\\nhistory; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins.\\n\\nCould she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had\\ntalked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out\\nof it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's\\nmind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; he\\ncertainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin\\nwould have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure\\nher. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always\\nin love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this\\nreappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of him\\nsomewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times every\\nday Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss him,\\n_just_ to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, _just_ to have something\\noccur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of\\nsurprize and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about\\nhim; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always among those who\\nsaw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting as\\nthe discussion of his concerns; and every report, therefore, every\\nguess--all that had already occurred, all that might occur in the\\narrangement of his affairs, comprehending income, servants, and\\nfurniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her regard was\\nreceiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept\\nalive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss\\nHawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much he seemed\\nattached!--his air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of his\\nhat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!\\n\\nHad it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her\\nfriend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's mind,\\nEmma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton\\npredominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful\\nas a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure of\\nthe agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the\\nknowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth\\nMartin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet had\\nnot been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her, written\\nin the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great\\ndeal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much\\noccupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,\\nand wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in\\nperson, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the Martins were\\nforgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again,\\nEmma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best\\nfor her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.\\n\\nHow that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--and\\nwhat might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.\\nAbsolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would\\nbe ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the\\nacquaintance--!\\n\\nAfter much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than\\nHarriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had\\nunderstanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal\\nacquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the\\nAbbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again\\nso soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\\nrecurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree\\nof intimacy was chosen for the future.\\n\\nShe could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it\\nwhich her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude, merely\\nglossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nSmall heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her\\nfriend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led her\\nto the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.\\nPhilip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of\\nbeing lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where\\nthe coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk\\nand the direction, was consequently a blank.\\n\\nShe went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be\\nput down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between\\nespalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which\\nhad given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to\\nrevive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her\\nto be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined\\nher not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour.\\nShe went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who\\nwas married, and settled in Donwell.\\n\\nThe quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\\nand Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and\\nunattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down the\\ngravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with\\nher seemingly with ceremonious civility.\\n\\nHarriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was\\nfeeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to\\nunderstand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.\\nShe had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her\\ndoubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had\\nbeen talked almost all the time--till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's\\nsaying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had\\nbrought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner. In that very\\nroom she had been measured last September, with her two friends. There\\nwere the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window.\\n_He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour,\\nthe party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness, the same\\nregrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they\\nwere just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect,\\nas ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when the carriage\\nreappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and the shortness\\nof it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given\\nto those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months\\nago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they might\\nresent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. She\\nwould have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had\\nthe Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a\\n_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she\\nhave done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent. They must be\\nseparated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--so much\\nto herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little\\nconsolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to\\nprocure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The\\nrefreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\\n\\nIt was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither\\n\"master nor mistress was at home;\" they had both been out some time; the\\nman believed they were gone to Hartfield.\\n\\n\"This is too bad,\" cried Emma, as they turned away. \"And now we shall\\njust miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so\\ndisappointed.\" And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her\\nmurmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--such being\\nthe commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriage\\nstopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were\\nstanding to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight of\\nthem, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston\\nimmediately accosted her with,\\n\\n\"How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--glad\\nto see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter this\\nmorning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--he is at\\nOxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be\\nso. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I\\nwas always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\\njust the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall\\nenjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could\\nwish.\"\\n\\nThere was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\\ninfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all was\\nby the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not\\nless to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was\\nenough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice in\\ntheir joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits.\\nThe worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in\\nthe rapidity of half a moment's thought, she hoped Mr. Elton would now\\nbe talked of no more.\\n\\nMr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which\\nallowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command,\\nas well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened,\\nand smiled, and congratulated.\\n\\n\"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,\" said he, at the conclusion.\\n\\nEmma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his\\nwife.\\n\\n\"We had better move on, Mr. Weston,\" said she, \"we are detaining the\\ngirls.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, I am ready;\"--and turning again to Emma, \"but you must\\nnot be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only\\nhad _my_ account you know; I dare say he is really nothing\\nextraordinary:\"--though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were\\nspeaking a very different conviction.\\n\\nEmma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a\\nmanner that appropriated nothing.\\n\\n\"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,\" was Mrs.\\nWeston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only\\nfor her.\\n\\n\"Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,\" was Mr.\\nWeston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\\nEmma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore\\na different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as\\nbefore. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least\\nmust soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw\\nsomething like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\\n\\n\"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?\"--was a\\nquestion, however, which did not augur much.\\n\\nBut neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma\\nwas now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.\\n\\nThe morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithful\\npupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o'clock, that\\nshe was to think of her at four.\\n\\n\"My dear, dear anxious friend,\"--said she, in mental soliloquy, while\\nwalking downstairs from her own room, \"always overcareful for every\\nbody's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets,\\ngoing again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.\"\\nThe clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. \"'Tis twelve;\\nI shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this\\ntime to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the\\npossibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him\\nsoon.\"\\n\\nShe opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her\\nfather--Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few\\nminutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank's\\nbeing a day before his time, and her father was yet in the midst of his\\nvery civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared, to have her\\nshare of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.\\n\\nThe Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually\\nbefore her--he was presented to her, and she did not think too much had\\nbeen said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young man; height,\\nair, address, all were unexceptionable, and his countenance had a great\\ndeal of the spirit and liveliness of his father's; he looked quick and\\nsensible. She felt immediately that she should like him; and there was\\na well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her\\nthat he came intending to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted\\nthey soon must be.\\n\\nHe had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the\\neagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel\\nearlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.\\n\\n\"I told you yesterday,\" cried Mr. Weston with exultation, \"I told you\\nall that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I\\nused to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help\\ngetting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in\\nupon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal\\nmore than any little exertion it needs.\"\\n\\n\"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,\" said the young\\nman, \"though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\\nbut in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.\"\\n\\nThe word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\\nEmma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the\\nconviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased\\nwith Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly\\nallow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to\\nHighbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself\\nto have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but\\none's _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That\\nhe should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,\\npassed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a\\nfalsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner had\\nno air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if in a\\nstate of no common enjoyment.\\n\\nTheir subjects in general were such as belong to an opening\\nacquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,--\"Was she a\\nhorsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--Pleasant walks?--Had they a large\\nneighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?--There were\\nseveral very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was\\nit a musical society?\"\\n\\nBut when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\\nproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while\\ntheir two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his\\nmother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so much\\nwarm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his\\nfather, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an additional\\nproof of his knowing how to please--and of his certainly thinking it\\nworth while to try to please her. He did not advance a word of praise\\nbeyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but,\\nundoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He understood\\nwhat would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. \"His father's\\nmarriage,\" he said, \"had been the wisest measure, every friend must\\nrejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing\\nmust be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on\\nhim.\"\\n\\nHe got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,\\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\\nwas to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's\\ncharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if\\nresolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its\\nobject, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of\\nher person.\\n\\n\"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,\" said he; \"but I\\nconfess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a\\nvery tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that\\nI was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,\"\\nsaid Emma; \"were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen with\\npleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such\\nwords. Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty\\nyoung woman.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I should know better,\" he replied; \"no, depend upon it, (with a\\ngallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom\\nI might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my\\nterms.\"\\n\\nEmma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from\\ntheir knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her mind,\\nhad ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered\\nas marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must see more\\nof him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they were\\nagreeable.\\n\\nShe had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick\\neye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy\\nexpression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she was\\nconfident that he was often listening.\\n\\nHer own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\\nentire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,\\nwas a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from\\napproving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--Though always objecting\\nto every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from\\nthe apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of\\nany two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it\\nwere proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could\\nnow, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a\\nglance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all\\nhis natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.\\nFrank Churchill's accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils\\nof sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed\\nanxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold--which,\\nhowever, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till\\nafter another night.\\n\\nA reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--\"He must be going.\\nHe had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands for\\nMrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else.\" His son,\\ntoo well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,\\n\\n\"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity\\nof paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore\\nmay as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with\\na neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near\\nHighbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty,\\nI suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not\\nthe proper name--I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any\\nfamily of that name?\"\\n\\n\"To be sure we do,\" cried his father; \"Mrs. Bates--we passed her\\nhouse--I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted\\nwith Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl\\nshe is. Call upon her, by all means.\"\\n\\n\"There is no necessity for my calling this morning,\" said the young man;\\n\"another day would do as well; but there was that degree of acquaintance\\nat Weymouth which--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done\\ncannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\\nany want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided. You saw\\nher with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she mixed\\nwith, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough\\nto live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.\"\\n\\nThe son looked convinced.\\n\\n\"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,\" said Emma; \"she is a very\\nelegant young woman.\"\\n\\nHe agreed to it, but with so quiet a \"Yes,\" as inclined her almost to\\ndoubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort\\nof elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought\\nonly ordinarily gifted with it.\\n\\n\"If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,\" said she,\\n\"I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her and\\nhear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has an\\naunt who never holds her tongue.\"\\n\\n\"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?\" said Mr.\\nWoodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; \"then give\\nme leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young\\nlady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very\\nworthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely\\nglad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to\\nshew you the way.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.\"\\n\\n\"But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\\nquite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many\\nhouses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\\nunless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you\\nhad best cross the street.\"\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\\nand his father gave his hearty support by calling out, \"My good friend,\\nthis is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees\\nit, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown in a hop,\\nstep, and jump.\"\\n\\nThey were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a\\ngraceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma remained\\nvery well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now\\nengage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with full\\nconfidence in their comfort.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nThe next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs.\\nWeston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He had\\nbeen sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till\\nher usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk,\\nimmediately fixed on Highbury.--\"He did not doubt there being very\\npleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always\\nchuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,\\nwould be his constant attraction.\"--Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood\\nfor Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with\\nhim. They walked thither directly.\\n\\nEmma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for\\nhalf a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew\\nnothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,\\ntherefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in\\narm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in\\ncompany with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him\\nwas to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends\\nfor it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It\\nwas not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his\\nduty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to\\nher--nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as\\na friend and securing her affection. And there was time enough for Emma\\nto form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of\\nthe morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour\\nor two--first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards\\nin Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield\\nsufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was\\nresolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole\\nvillage, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than\\nEmma could have supposed.\\n\\nSome of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He\\nbegged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and\\nwhich had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting that\\nan old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of\\nher cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in\\nsome points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they\\nshewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must\\nbe very like a merit to those he was with.\\n\\nEmma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it\\ncould not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting\\nhimself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of\\ninsincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him\\njustice.\\n\\nTheir first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though\\nthe principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses\\nwere kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any\\nrun on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by\\nany interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of\\nthe large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for\\na ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly\\npopulous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but such\\nbrilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for\\nwhich it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established\\namong the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately\\ninterested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of\\npassing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed\\nwindows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,\\nand lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no fault\\nin the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it\\nwas long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the\\nvery number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every\\nfortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived\\nthe former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in\\nHighbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\\nthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted\\nto attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be\\npersuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could\\nnot furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars\\nwere given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that\\nthe inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there\\nwould be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their\\nproper place the next morning. He argued like a young man very much bent\\non dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of\\nthe Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.\\nHe seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social\\ninclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of\\nEnscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his\\nindifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of\\nmind. He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.\\nIt was but an effusion of lively spirits.\\n\\nAt last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;\\nand being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma\\nrecollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had\\npaid it.\\n\\n\"Yes, oh! yes\"--he replied; \"I was just going to mention it. A very\\nsuccessful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much\\nobliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken\\nme quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I\\nwas only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes\\nwould have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and\\nI had told my father I should certainly be at home before him--but there\\nwas no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found,\\nwhen he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had\\nbeen actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour.\\nThe good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.\"\\n\\n\"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?\"\\n\\n\"Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look\\nill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladies\\ncan never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so\\npale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--A most\\ndeplorable want of complexion.\"\\n\\nEmma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax's\\ncomplexion. \"It was certainly never brilliant, but she would not\\nallow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and\\ndelicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of\\nher face.\" He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he had\\nheard many people say the same--but yet he must confess, that to him\\nnothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Where\\nfeatures were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all;\\nand where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he need not\\nattempt to describe what the effect was.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Emma, \"there is no disputing about taste.--At least you\\nadmire her except her complexion.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head and laughed.--\"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her\\ncomplexion.\"\\n\\n\"Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?\"\\n\\nAt this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed,\\n\"Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of\\ntheir lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he\\nsays, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.\\nIf it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\\nmyself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must\\nbuy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.--I dare say\\nthey sell gloves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will\\nbe adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because\\nyou were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at Ford's, and your\\npopularity will stand upon your own virtues.\"\\n\\nThey went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of \"Men's Beavers\"\\nand \"York Tan\" were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he\\nsaid--\"But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,\\nyou were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_\\n_patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of\\npublic fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in\\nprivate life.\"\\n\\n\"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her\\nparty at Weymouth.\"\\n\\n\"And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\\nvery unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on the degree\\nof acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--I\\nshall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But\\nher account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very\\nreserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any\\nbody, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance\\nwith her.\"\\n\\n\"May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so\\nwell. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a\\nlittle in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\\nColonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,\\nwarm-hearted woman. I like them all.\"\\n\\n\"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she is\\ndestined to be?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do.\"\\n\\n\"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,\" said Mrs. Weston smiling;\\n\"remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say\\nwhen you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I will move a little\\nfarther off.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly do forget to think of _her_,\" said Emma, \"as having ever\\nbeen any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.\"\\n\\nHe looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.\\n\\nWhen the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, \"Did\\nyou ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?\" said Frank\\nChurchill.\\n\\n\"Ever hear her!\" repeated Emma. \"You forget how much she belongs to\\nHighbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.\\nShe plays charmingly.\"\\n\\n\"You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who\\ncould really judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with\\nconsiderable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--I am\\nexcessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right\\nof judging of any body's performance.--I have been used to hear her's\\nadmired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--a\\nman, a very musical man, and in love with another woman--engaged to\\nher--on the point of marriage--would yet never ask that other woman\\nto sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down\\ninstead--never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.\\nThat, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.\"\\n\\n\"Proof indeed!\" said Emma, highly amused.--\"Mr. Dixon is very musical,\\nis he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,\\nthan Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a\\nvery strong proof.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger\\nthan, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable\\nto me. I could not excuse a man's having more music than love--more ear\\nthan eye--a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.\\nHow did Miss Campbell appear to like it?\"\\n\\n\"It was her very particular friend, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Poor comfort!\" said Emma, laughing. \"One would rather have a stranger\\npreferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it might\\nnot recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend\\nalways at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--Poor\\nMrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.\"\\n\\n\"You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she\\nreally did not seem to feel it.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which. But\\nbe it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship, or\\ndulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt\\nit: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous\\ndistinction.\"\\n\\n\"As to that--I do not--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's\\nsensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human\\nbeing, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she\\nwas asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.\"\\n\\n\"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--\"\\nhe began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, \"however, it is\\nimpossible for me to say on what terms they really were--how it might\\nall be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness\\noutwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be\\na better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct\\nherself in critical situations, than I can be.\"\\n\\n\"I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children\\nand women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be\\nintimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited\\nher friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a\\nlittle, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take\\ndisgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was,\\nby her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve--I\\nnever could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.\"\\n\\n\"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,\" said he. \"Oftentimes very\\nconvenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,\\nbut no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.\"\\n\\n\"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction\\nmay be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an\\nagreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of\\nconquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss\\nFairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think\\nill of her--not the least--except that such extreme and perpetual\\ncautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea\\nabout any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to\\nconceal.\"\\n\\nHe perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and\\nthinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,\\nthat she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He was\\nnot exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in some\\nof his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better\\nthan she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate--his feelings\\nwarmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr.\\nElton's house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look at,\\nand would not join them in finding much fault with. No, he could not\\nbelieve it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for\\nhaving. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not\\nthink any man to be pitied for having that house. There must be ample\\nroom in it for every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead who\\nwanted more.\\n\\nMrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.\\nUsed only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many\\nadvantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could be no\\njudge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one. But Emma,\\nin her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he was talking\\nabout, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in\\nlife, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not be aware of the\\ninroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or\\na bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe\\ncould not make him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would\\nwillingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nEmma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the\\nfollowing day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to have\\nhis hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, and\\nhe had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner,\\nbut with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut.\\nThere was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over\\non such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it\\nwhich she could not approve. It did not accord with the rationality of\\nplan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart,\\nwhich she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. Vanity,\\nextravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be\\ndoing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his\\nfather and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear\\nin general; he became liable to all these charges. His father only\\ncalled him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs.\\nWeston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as\\nquickly as possible, and making no other comment than that \"all young\\npeople would have their little whims.\"\\n\\nWith the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\\nhitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston\\nwas very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made\\nhimself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He\\nappeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and\\nlively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal\\ndecidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of\\ntalking of him--said he would be the best man in the world if he were\\nleft to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he\\nacknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to\\nspeak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for\\nsuch an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to\\ndenote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination\\nhad given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her,\\nof being at least very near it, and saved only by her own\\nindifference--(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the\\nhonour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint\\nacquaintance.\\n\\nMr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must\\nhave some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her\\nextremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so\\nmuch to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him\\nharshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, \"all young people would have their\\nlittle whims.\"\\n\\nThere was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\\nleniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of\\nDonwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made\\nfor the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so\\noften and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be\\nsoftened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley.\\nThe circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was\\nsilent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself,\\nover a newspaper he held in his hand, \"Hum! just the trifling, silly\\nfellow I took him for.\" She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's\\nobservation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his\\nown feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.\\n\\nAlthough in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and\\nMrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly\\nopportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma\\nwant their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly\\nthe advice they gave.\\n\\nThis was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in\\nHighbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, and\\nunpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade,\\nand only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country,\\nthey had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little\\ncompany, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had\\nbrought them a considerable increase of means--the house in town had\\nyielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. With\\ntheir wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their\\ninclination for more company. They added to their house, to their number\\nof servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were,\\nin fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.\\nTheir love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body\\nfor their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the\\nsingle men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma\\ncould hardly suppose they would presume to invite--neither Donwell, nor\\nHartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go, if they did;\\nand she regretted that her father's known habits would be giving\\nher refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were very\\nrespectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not\\nfor them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit\\nthem. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from\\nherself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\\n\\nBut she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks\\nbefore it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her\\nvery differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their\\ninvitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.\\nWeston's accounting for it with \"I suppose they will not take the\\nliberty with you; they know you do not dine out,\" was not quite\\nsufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of\\nrefusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there,\\nconsisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurred\\nagain and again, she did not know that she might not have been tempted\\nto accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. They\\nhad been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,\\nand Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence. Might\\nnot the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his. The bare\\npossibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and\\nher being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be\\nintended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\\n\\nIt was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at\\nHartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first\\nremark, on reading it, was that \"of course it must be declined,\" she so\\nvery soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their\\nadvice for her going was most prompt and successful.\\n\\nShe owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely\\nwithout inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so\\nproperly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so much\\nconsideration for her father. \"They would have solicited the honour\\nearlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from\\nLondon, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of\\nair, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour\\nof his company.\" Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being\\nbriefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting\\nhis comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be\\ndepended on for bearing him company--Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked\\ninto an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on a day now\\nnear at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As for _his_\\ngoing, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be\\ntoo late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned.\\n\\n\"I am not fond of dinner-visiting,\" said he--\"I never was. No more is\\nEmma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole\\nshould have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come\\nin one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us--take us\\nin their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so\\nreasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the\\nevening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any\\nbody to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine\\nwith them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take\\ncare of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what\\nit ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.\" Then turning to Mrs.\\nWeston, with a look of gentle reproach--\"Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not\\nmarried, you would have staid at home with me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"as I took Miss Taylor away, it is\\nincumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.\\nGoddard in a moment, if you wish it.\"\\n\\nBut the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,\\nnot lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how\\nto allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately\\narranged.\\n\\nWith this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking\\nas usual. \"He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regard\\nfor Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. James\\ncould take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer written\\nto Mrs. Cole.\"\\n\\n\"You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will say\\nthat I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline\\ntheir obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of course.\\nBut you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be\\ndone. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be\\nwanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have never\\nbeen there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have\\nno doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there,\\nyou must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again;\\nand you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying late.\\nYou will get very tired when tea is over.\"\\n\\n\"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many\\npeople talking at once. You will not like the noise.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"if Emma comes away early, it will\\nbe breaking up the party.\"\\n\\n\"And no great harm if it does,\" said Mr. Woodhouse. \"The sooner every\\nparty breaks up, the better.\"\\n\\n\"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's going\\naway directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured\\npeople, and think little of their own claims; but still they must\\nfeel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss\\nWoodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any other person's in\\nthe room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am\\nsure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have\\nbeen your neighbours these _ten_ years.\"\\n\\n\"No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to\\nyou for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any\\npain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole\\nnever touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but\\nhe is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means\\nof giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,\\nrather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a\\nlittle longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You\\nwill be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no\\nscruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am\\nonly afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being\\nexceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you\\nknow; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by\\nyourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time--and the idea of\\nthat would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit\\nup.\"\\n\\nHe did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that,\\nif she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if\\nhungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should\\nsit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every\\nthing were safe in the house, as usual.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nFrank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's dinner\\nwaiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious\\nfor his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection\\nwhich could be concealed.\\n\\nHe came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very\\ngood grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had\\ndone. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusion\\nof face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his spirits.\\nHe was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him,\\nEmma thus moralised to herself:--\\n\\n\"I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things\\ndo cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent\\nway. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.--It\\ndepends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is\\n_not_ a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this\\ndifferently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or\\nbeen ashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of\\na coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own\\nvanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.\"\\n\\nWith Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for\\na longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by\\ninference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing\\nhow soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air;\\nand of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were\\nnow seeing them together for the first time.\\n\\nShe meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.\\nCole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.\\nElton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than\\nhis propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.\\n\\nHer father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.\\nGoddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left\\nthe house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after\\ndinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her\\ndress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping\\nthem to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever\\nunwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged\\nthem to practise during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner\\nfor them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat\\nit.\\n\\nShe followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased to see\\nthat it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,\\nhaving little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and\\nindependence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he could,\\nand not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.\\nShe had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from\\nher heart, for he stopped to hand her out.\\n\\n\"This is coming as you should do,\" said she; \"like a gentleman.--I am\\nquite glad to see you.\"\\n\\nHe thanked her, observing, \"How lucky that we should arrive at the same\\nmoment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether\\nyou would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--You\\nmight not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.\"\\n\\n\"Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of\\nconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be\\nbeneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but\\nwith you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always\\nobserve it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. _Now_ you have\\nnothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed. You\\nare not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_ I shall really\\nbe very happy to walk into the same room with you.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsensical girl!\" was his reply, but not at all in anger.\\n\\nEmma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as\\nwith Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could\\nnot but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for.\\nWhen the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of\\nadmiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached\\nher with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,\\nand at dinner she found him seated by her--and, as she firmly believed,\\nnot without some dexterity on his side.\\n\\nThe party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\\nunobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of\\nnaming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family,\\nthe lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the\\nevening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already,\\nat dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be\\ngeneral; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could\\nfairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour.\\nThe first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend, was\\nthe name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of\\nher that was expected to be very interesting. She listened, and found\\nit well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her fancy,\\nreceived an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been\\ncalling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had\\nbeen struck by the sight of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking\\ninstrument--not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the\\nsubstance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of\\nsurprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanations\\non Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from\\nBroadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and\\nniece--entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account,\\nJane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could\\npossibly have ordered it--but now, they were both perfectly satisfied\\nthat it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from\\nColonel Campbell.\\n\\n\"One can suppose nothing else,\" added Mrs. Cole, \"and I was only\\nsurprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,\\nhad a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.\\nShe knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as\\nany reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse\\nto surprize her.\"\\n\\nMrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the\\nsubject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,\\nand equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were\\nenough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still\\nlisten to Mrs. Cole.\\n\\n\"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me\\nmore satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who\\nplays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite\\na shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine\\ninstruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves\\na slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole,\\nI really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the\\ndrawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little\\ngirls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of\\nit; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\\nany thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old\\nspinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to\\nMr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so\\nparticularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself\\nin the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so\\nobliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that\\nreally is the reason why the instrument was bought--or else I am sure\\nwe ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse\\nmay be prevailed with to try it this evening.\"\\n\\nMiss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing\\nmore was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, turned\\nto Frank Churchill.\\n\\n\"Why do you smile?\" said she.\\n\\n\"Nay, why do you?\"\\n\\n\"Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so rich\\nand so liberal.--It is a handsome present.\"\\n\\n\"Very.\"\\n\\n\"I rather wonder that it was never made before.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.\"\\n\\n\"Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--which must\\nnow be shut up in London, untouched by any body.\"\\n\\n\"That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.\\nBates's house.\"\\n\\n\"You may _say_ what you chuse--but your countenance testifies that your\\n_thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\\nacuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably\\nsuspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\\nthere is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can\\nbe?\"\\n\\n\"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She must\\nknow as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and\\nperhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young\\nwoman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I\\ntold you that your suspicions would guide mine.\"\\n\\n\"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Dixon.--Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the\\njoint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day, you\\nknow, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had\\nentertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions\\nof either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either\\nthat, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune\\nto fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a little\\nattachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without guessing\\nexactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for\\nher chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells\\nto Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and penance;\\nthere it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her\\nnative air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might\\nhave passed; but what can any body's native air do for them in the\\nmonths of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages would\\nbe much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare\\nsay in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though\\nyou make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what\\nthey are.\"\\n\\n\"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon's\\npreference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for being very\\ndecided.\"\\n\\n\"And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?--A water\\nparty; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.\"\\n\\n\"He did. I was there--one of the party.\"\\n\\n\"Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course, for it\\nseems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think I should\\nhave made some discoveries.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that\\nMiss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught\\nher.--It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent shock and\\nalarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I believe it was\\nhalf an hour before any of us were comfortable again--yet that was too\\ngeneral a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be\\nobservable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made\\ndiscoveries.\"\\n\\nThe conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share\\nin the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and\\nobliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the table\\nwas again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed exactly\\nright, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma said,\\n\\n\"The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know\\na little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall\\nsoon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.\"\\n\\n\"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must\\nconclude it to come from the Campbells.\"\\n\\n\"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is\\nnot from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She\\nwould not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have\\nconvinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr.\\nDixon is a principal in the business.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings\\ncarry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed\\nyou satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as\\npaternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.\\nBut when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it\\nshould be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it in\\nno other light than as an offering of love.\"\\n\\nThere was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction seemed\\nreal; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other subjects\\ntook their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert\\nsucceeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the\\nusual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downright\\nsilly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the\\nother--nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news,\\nand heavy jokes.\\n\\nThe ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other\\nladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree\\nof her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her\\ndignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and\\nthe artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,\\ncheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many\\nalleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed\\naffection. There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she\\nhad been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and\\nseeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say\\nnothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax\\ndid look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been\\nglad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the\\nmortification of having loved--yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in\\nvain--by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself\\nbeloved by the husband of her friend.\\n\\nIn so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\\nShe did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the\\nsecret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,\\nand therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the\\nsubject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of\\nconsciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush\\nof guilt which accompanied the name of \"my excellent friend Colonel\\nCampbell.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested\\nby the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\\nperseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and\\nto say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish\\nof saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the\\nfair heroine's countenance.\\n\\nThey were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first\\nof the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the\\nhandsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates\\nand her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,\\nwhere sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her, would\\nnot sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be thinking.\\nShe was his object, and every body must perceive it. She introduced him\\nto her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard\\nwhat each thought of the other. \"He had never seen so lovely a face, and\\nwas delighted with her naivete.\" And she, \"Only to be sure it was paying\\nhim too great a compliment, but she did think there were some looks a\\nlittle like Mr. Elton.\" Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned\\nfrom her in silence.\\n\\nSmiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\\nglancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\\nHe told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--hated\\nsitting long--was always the first to move when he could--that his\\nfather, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over\\nparish business--that as long as he had staid, however, it had been\\npleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike,\\nsensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether--thought it\\nso abundant in agreeable families--that Emma began to feel she had been\\nused to despise the place rather too much. She questioned him as to the\\nsociety in Yorkshire--the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe,\\nand the sort; and could make out from his answers that, as far as\\nEnscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that their\\nvisitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and\\nthat even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even\\nchance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;\\nthat they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though\\nhe had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without\\nconsiderable address _at_ _times_, that he could get away, or introduce\\nan acquaintance for a night.\\n\\nShe saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at\\nits best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at\\nhome than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He did\\nnot boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded his\\naunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and noticing\\nit, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he could\\n_with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing. One of those points on which\\nhis influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much to\\ngo abroad--had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel--but she\\nwould not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he said,\\nhe was beginning to have no longer the same wish.\\n\\nThe unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be\\ngood behaviour to his father.\\n\\n\"I have made a most wretched discovery,\" said he, after a short pause.--\\n\"I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time. I never knew days fly\\nso fast. A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself.\\nBut just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--I hate the\\nrecollection.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out\\nof so few, in having your hair cut.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said he, smiling, \"that is no subject of regret at all. I have\\nno pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be\\nseen.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\\nobliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole. When\\nMr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as before,\\nshe saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss\\nFairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" said she.\\n\\nHe started. \"Thank you for rousing me,\" he replied. \"I believe I have\\nbeen very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a\\nway--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw\\nany thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own. I\\nsee nobody else looking like her!--I must go and ask her whether it\\nis an Irish fashion. Shall I?--Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you\\nshall see how she takes it;--whether she colours.\"\\n\\nHe was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\\nFairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,\\nas he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in\\nfront of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\\n\\nBefore he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\\n\\n\"This is the luxury of a large party,\" said she:--\"one can get near\\nevery body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk\\nto you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like\\nyourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how\\nMiss Bates and her niece came here?\"\\n\\n\"How?--They were invited, were not they?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their\\ncoming?\"\\n\\n\"They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?\"\\n\\n\"Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad\\nit would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and\\ncold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw\\nher appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and\\nwould therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could\\nnot bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,\\nand I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may guess\\nhow readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made\\nmy way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be\\nat her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making\\nher comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you\\nmay be sure. 'Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,\\nmany thanks--'there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's\\ncarriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quite\\nsurprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a\\nvery kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thing\\nthat so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his\\nusual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their\\naccommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he would not\\nhave had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse\\nfor assisting them.\"\\n\\n\"Very likely,\" said Emma--\"nothing more likely. I know no man more\\nlikely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing\\nreally good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a\\ngallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane\\nFairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for\\nan act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on\\nmore than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day--for we arrived\\ntogether; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that\\ncould betray.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"you give him credit for more simple,\\ndisinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss\\nBates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never\\nbeen able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable\\nit appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane\\nFairfax. See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!\" exclaimed Emma. \"Dear Mrs. Weston, how\\ncould you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley must not\\nmarry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--Oh! no,\\nno, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley's\\nmarrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am amazed that you\\nshould think of such a thing.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not want\\nthe match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--but the idea has\\nbeen given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to\\nmarry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's account, a boy of six\\nyears old, who knows nothing of the matter?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--Mr.\\nKnightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt\\nit now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!\"\\n\\n\"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well\\nknow.\"\\n\\n\"But the imprudence of such a match!\"\\n\\n\"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.\"\\n\\n\"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than\\nwhat you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would\\nbe quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for the\\nBateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--and is always glad to\\nshew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making.\\nYou do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh! no,\\nno;--every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not have him do so\\nmad a thing.\"\\n\\n\"Imprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,\\nand perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.\"\\n\\n\"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the\\nleast idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?--He\\nis as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and\\nhis library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of\\nhis brother's children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up\\nhis time or his heart.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves\\nJane Fairfax--\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am\\nsure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but--\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, laughing, \"perhaps the greatest good he could\\ndo them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.\"\\n\\n\"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a\\nvery shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss\\nBates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking\\nhim all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--'So very\\nkind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!'\\nAnd then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother's old\\npetticoat. 'Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for still\\nit would last a great while--and, indeed, she must thankfully say that\\ntheir petticoats were all very strong.'\"\\n\\n\"For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my conscience.\\nAnd, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed\\nby Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; and\\nif he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and\\ndrown her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad\\nconnexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I have\\nheard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The\\ninterest he takes in her--his anxiety about her health--his concern that\\nshe should have no happier prospect! I have heard him express himself\\nso warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the\\npianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen\\nto her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred\\nto me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--though\\nwe have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the\\nCampbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting\\nhim. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in\\nlove.\"\\n\\n\"Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not\\nthink it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does\\nnothing mysteriously.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener\\nthan I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of\\nthings, occur to him.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told\\nher so.\"\\n\\n\"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strong\\nnotion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly silent when\\nMrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.\"\\n\\n\"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\\nmany a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment--I\\nbelieve nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince me that\\nMr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.\"\\n\\nThey combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\\ngaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most\\nused of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them\\nthat tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--and at the same\\nmoment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the\\nhonour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her\\nconversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that\\nhe had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his very\\npressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to\\nlead, she gave a very proper compliance.\\n\\nShe knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than\\nshe could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in\\nthe little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany\\nher own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by\\nsurprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her\\npardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual\\nfollowed. He was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect\\nknowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing\\nof the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang\\ntogether once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss\\nFairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could\\nattempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.\\n\\nWith mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\\nnumbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.\\nThey had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the\\nsight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half\\nEmma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of\\nMrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices\\ngave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley's\\nmarrying did not in the least subside. She could see nothing but evil\\nin it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley;\\nconsequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children--a most\\nmortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very great\\ndeduction from her father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could\\nnot at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.\\nKnightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never\\nmarry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\\n\\nPresently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They\\ntalked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly\\nvery warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have\\nstruck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his\\nkindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in\\nthe spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only\\nhis disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.\\n\\n\"I often feel concern,\" said she, \"that I dare not make our carriage\\nmore useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; but\\nyou know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to\\nfor such a purpose.\"\\n\\n\"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,\" he\\nreplied;--\"but you must often wish it, I am sure.\" And he smiled with\\nsuch seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another\\nstep.\\n\\n\"This present from the Campbells,\" said she--\"this pianoforte is very\\nkindly given.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he replied, and without the smallest apparent\\nembarrassment.--\"But they would have done better had they given\\nher notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not\\nenhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have\\nexpected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.\"\\n\\nFrom that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had\\nhad no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were\\nentirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual\\npreference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane's\\nsecond song, her voice grew thick.\\n\\n\"That will do,\" said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--\"you have\\nsung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.\"\\n\\nAnother song, however, was soon begged for. \"One more;--they would not\\nfatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.\"\\nAnd Frank Churchill was heard to say, \"I think you could manage this\\nwithout effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the\\nsong falls on the second.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley grew angry.\\n\\n\"That fellow,\" said he, indignantly, \"thinks of nothing but shewing off\\nhis own voice. This must not be.\" And touching Miss Bates, who at that\\nmoment passed near--\"Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing\\nherself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on\\nher.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to\\nbe grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther\\nsinging. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse\\nand Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within\\nfive minutes) the proposal of dancing--originating nobody exactly knew\\nwhere--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every\\nthing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. Weston,\\ncapital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible\\nwaltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to\\nEmma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.\\n\\nWhile waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\\nEmma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on\\nher voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.\\nKnightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he\\nwere to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur\\nsomething. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to Mrs.\\nCole--he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,\\nand he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\\n\\nEmma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and\\nshe led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than\\nfive couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of\\nit made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a\\npartner. They were a couple worth looking at.\\n\\nTwo dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was\\ngrowing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her mother's\\naccount. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again,\\nthey were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.\\n\\n\"Perhaps it is as well,\" said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma to\\nher carriage. \"I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing\\nwould not have agreed with me, after yours.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nEmma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit\\nafforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she\\nmight be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must\\nbe amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted\\nthe Coles--worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!--And left a\\nname behind her that would not soon die away.\\n\\nPerfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two\\npoints on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not\\ntransgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of\\nJane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it\\nhad been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his submission\\nto all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which made\\nit difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her\\ntongue.\\n\\nThe other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and\\nthere she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the\\ninferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily\\ngrieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat down and practised\\nvigorously an hour and a half.\\n\\nShe was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise\\ncould have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\\n\\n\"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!\"\\n\\n\"Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her's,\\nthan a lamp is like sunshine.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite\\nas well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body\\nlast night said how well you played.\"\\n\\n\"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The\\ntruth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\\nbut Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or\\nthat if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole\\nsaid how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal\\nabout your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any\\ntaste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.--There is no\\nunderstanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you\\nknow, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to\\nteach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into\\nany great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?\"\\n\\n\"Just as they always do--very vulgar.\"\\n\\n\"They told me something,\" said Harriet rather hesitatingly; \"but it is\\nnothing of any consequence.\"\\n\\nEmma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its\\nproducing Mr. Elton.\\n\\n\"They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay to\\ndinner.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know\\nwhat she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there\\nagain next summer.\"\\n\\n\"She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should\\nbe.\"\\n\\n\"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her at\\ndinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\\ngirls in Highbury.\"\\n\\nHarriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with\\nher. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in\\nher present state, would be dangerous.\\n\\nHarriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always\\nvery long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins\\nand changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could\\nnot be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--Mr.\\nPerry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the\\noffice-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a\\nstray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she\\ncould presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with\\nhis tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full\\nbasket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling\\nchildren round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she\\nknew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough\\nstill to stand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with\\nseeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.\\n\\nShe looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons\\nappeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into\\nHighbury;--to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the\\nfirst place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer\\nRandalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their\\neye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the\\nagreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to\\nthe present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call\\non the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.\\n\\n\"For my companion tells me,\" said she, \"that I absolutely promised Miss\\nBates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it\\nmyself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I\\nam going now.\"\\n\\n\"And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,\" said\\nFrank Churchill, \"to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--if\\nyou are going home.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was disappointed.\\n\\n\"I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.\"\\n\\n\"Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps--I may be equally in the\\nway here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt always\\nsends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death; and\\nMiss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. What am I to\\ndo?\"\\n\\n\"I am here on no business of my own,\" said Emma; \"I am only waiting for\\nmy friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.\\nBut you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.\"\\n\\n\"Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should\\nhave employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an\\nindifferent tone--what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.\\nWeston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be\\npalatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world\\nat a civil falsehood.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe any such thing,\" replied Emma.--\"I am persuaded that\\nyou can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but\\nthere is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite\\notherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night.\"\\n\\n\"Do come with me,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"if it be not very disagreeable to\\nyou. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards.\\nWe will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It\\nwill be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.\"\\n\\nHe could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\\nreturned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched them in,\\nand then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all\\nthe force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\\nmuslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be\\nit ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At\\nlast it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\\n\\n\"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?\" asked Mrs.\\nFord.--\"Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at\\nHartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,\\nMrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown\\nhome any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly--so it had better go\\nto Hartfield--at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,\\nMrs. Ford, could not you?\"\\n\\n\"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two\\nparcels.\"\\n\\n\"No more it is.\"\\n\\n\"No trouble in the world, ma'am,\" said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\\n\\n\"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you\\nplease, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--I do not know--No, I\\nthink, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and\\ntake it home with me at night. What do you advise?\"\\n\\n\"That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,\\nif you please, Mrs. Ford.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, that will be much best,\" said Harriet, quite satisfied, \"I should\\nnot at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.\"\\n\\nVoices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.\\nWeston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Woodhouse,\" said the latter, \"I am just run across to\\nentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\\nand give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How\\ndo you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston\\nto come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.\"\\n\\n\"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--\"\\n\\n\"Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;\\nand Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad\\nto hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--Oh!\\nthen, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me\\njust to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so\\nvery happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party, she cannot\\nrefuse.--'Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Miss Woodhouse's\\nopinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--But, said I, I shall\\nbe more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--'Oh,' said\\nhe, 'wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'--For, would you\\nbelieve it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in\\nthe world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.--The rivet\\ncame out, you know, this morning.--So very obliging!--For my mother had\\nno use of her spectacles--could not put them on. And, by the bye, every\\nbody ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said\\nso. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,\\nbut something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,\\nthen another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came\\nto say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I,\\nPatty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your\\nmistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis\\nsent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the\\nWallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be\\nuncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing\\nbut the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value\\nof our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?\\nOnly three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats\\nnothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened\\nif you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I\\nsay one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the\\nmiddle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so\\nwell as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took\\nthe opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet\\nhim in the street. Not that I had any doubt before--I have so often\\nheard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only\\nway that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We\\nhave apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent\\napple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these\\nladies will oblige us.\"\\n\\nEmma would be \"very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,\" and they did at\\nlast move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,\\n\\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.\\nI hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane\\ncame back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a\\nlittle too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.\"\\n\\n\"What was I talking of?\" said she, beginning again when they were all in\\nthe street.\\n\\nEmma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\\n\\n\"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother's\\nspectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! 'Oh!' said he,\\n'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind\\nexcessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must\\nsay that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,\\nhe very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,\\nmost warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could....\\n'Oh!' said he, 'I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort\\nexcessively.' I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out\\nthe baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very\\nobliging as to take some, 'Oh!' said he directly, 'there is nothing\\nin the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking\\nhome-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so\\nvery.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they\\nare very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--only\\nwe do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us\\npromise to have them done three times--but Miss Woodhouse will be so\\ngood as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest\\nsort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr.\\nKnightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and\\ncertainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his\\ntrees--I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was\\nalways famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the\\nother day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating\\nthese apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed\\nthem, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. 'I\\nam sure you must be,' said he, 'and I will send you another supply; for\\nI have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me\\nkeep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more,\\nbefore they get good for nothing.' So I begged he would not--for really\\nas to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great\\nmany left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept\\nfor Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more,\\nso liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when\\nhe was gone, she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say\\nquarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite\\ndistressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished\\nI had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear,\\nI did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William\\nLarkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of\\napples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down\\nand spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose.\\nWilliam Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see\\nhim. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it\\nwas all the apples of _that_ sort his master had; he had brought them\\nall--and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William did\\nnot seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had\\nsold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit\\nthan any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their\\nbeing all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not be\\nable to have another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid\\nher not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for\\nMrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks\\nwere sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told\\nme, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley\\nknow any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted\\nto keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it\\nbefore I was aware.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\\nwalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\\npursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\\n\\n\"Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take\\ncare, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--rather darker\\nand narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss\\nWoodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss\\nSmith, the step at the turning.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nThe appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was\\ntranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\\nslumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near\\nher, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\\nstanding with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\\n\\nBusy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy\\ncountenance on seeing Emma again.\\n\\n\"This is a pleasure,\" said he, in rather a low voice, \"coming at least\\nten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be\\nuseful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.\"\\n\\n\"What!\" said Mrs. Weston, \"have not you finished it yet? you would not\\nearn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.\"\\n\\n\"I have not been working uninterruptedly,\" he replied, \"I have been\\nassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\\nit was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see\\nwe have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to be\\npersuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.\"\\n\\nHe contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\\nemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make\\nher help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready\\nto sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately ready,\\nEmma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet\\npossessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she\\nmust reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not\\nbut pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve\\nnever to expose them to her neighbour again.\\n\\nAt last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the\\npowers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.\\nWeston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma\\njoined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper\\ndiscrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.\\n\\n\"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,\" said Frank Churchill, with a\\nsmile at Emma, \"the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of\\nColonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper\\nnotes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would\\nparticularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his\\nfriend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not you\\nthink so?\"\\n\\nJane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had\\nbeen speaking to her at the same moment.\\n\\n\"It is not fair,\" said Emma, in a whisper; \"mine was a random guess. Do\\nnot distress her.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\\ndoubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,\\n\\n\"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this\\noccasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and wonder\\nwhich will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's coming to\\nhand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going\\nforward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the consequence\\nof an immediate commission from him, or that he may have sent only\\na general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon\\ncontingencies and conveniences?\"\\n\\nHe paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\\n\\n\"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,\" said she, in a voice of\\nforced calmness, \"I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be\\nall conjecture.\"\\n\\n\"Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\\nconjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this\\nrivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard\\nat work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, hold their\\ntongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word--Miss\\nFairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have the\\npleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed\\nfor the present.\"\\n\\nHe was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a\\nlittle from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss\\nFairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.\\n\\n\"If you are very kind,\" said he, \"it will be one of the waltzes we\\ndanced last night;--let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them\\nas I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we\\ndanced no longer; but I would have given worlds--all the worlds one ever\\nhas to give--for another half-hour.\"\\n\\nShe played.\\n\\n\"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one\\nhappy!--If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.\"\\n\\nShe looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something\\nelse. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning\\nto Emma, said,\\n\\n\"Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.--And here\\nare a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might\\nexpect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of\\nColonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music\\nhere. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to\\nhave been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing\\nincomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.\"\\n\\nEmma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;\\nand when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains\\nof a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness,\\nthere had been a smile of secret delight, she had less scruple in the\\namusement, and much less compunction with respect to her.--This\\namiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very\\nreprehensible feelings.\\n\\nHe brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--Emma\\ntook the opportunity of whispering,\\n\\n\"You speak too plain. She must understand you.\"\\n\\n\"I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least\\nashamed of my meaning.\"\\n\\n\"But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now\\na key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does\\nwrong, she ought to feel it.\"\\n\\n\"She is not entirely without it, I think.\"\\n\\n\"I do not see much sign of it. She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this\\nmoment--_his_ favourite.\"\\n\\nShortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.\\nKnightley on horse-back not far off.\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible, just to\\nthank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;\\nbut I can go into my mother's room you know. I dare say he will come\\nin when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet\\nso!--Our little room so honoured!\"\\n\\nShe was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the\\ncasement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every\\nsyllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as\\nif it had passed within the same apartment.\\n\\n\"How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you\\nfor the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready\\nfor us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.\"\\n\\nSo began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in\\nhis turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,\\n\\n\"How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all, but\\nparticularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold\\nlast night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.\"\\n\\nAnd Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear\\nher in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave\\nEmma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in\\nsteady scepticism.\\n\\n\"So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,\"\\nresumed Miss Bates.\\n\\nHe cut her short with,\\n\\n\"I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she\\nwanted something from Kingston.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?--Miss\\nWoodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte.\\nDo put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, in a deliberating manner, \"for five minutes, perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;\\nso many friends!\"\\n\\n\"No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on\\nto Kingston as fast as I can.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.\"\\n\\n\"No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the\\npianoforte.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I am so sorry!--Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last\\nnight; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--Was not\\nit delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any\\nthing equal to it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss\\nWoodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.\\nAnd (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should\\nnot be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.\\nWeston is the very best country-dance player, without exception,\\nin England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say\\nsomething pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to\\nhear it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--so\\nshocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!\"\\n\\n\"What is the matter now?\"\\n\\n\"To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had\\na great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!\\nMrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You\\nshould not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never\\ncan bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it\\nwould have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to the\\nroom,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He is\\ngoing to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Jane, \"we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was\\nopen, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must\\nhave heard every thing to be sure. 'Can I do any thing for you at\\nKingston?' said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must you\\nbe going?--You seem but just come--so very obliging of you.\"\\n\\nEmma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted\\nlong; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived\\nto be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could\\nallow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield\\ngates, before they set off for Randalls.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nIt may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been\\nknown of young people passing many, many months successively, without\\nbeing at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue\\neither to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--when the\\nfelicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt--it\\nmust be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\\n\\nFrank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\\nand the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\\nto spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\\npeople in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; and his\\nthe greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the\\ndifficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance.\\nBut still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how\\ndelightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced--for\\ndoing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane\\nFairfax--and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked\\naids of vanity--to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in\\nto see what it could be made to hold--and then in taking the dimensions\\nof the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that\\nMr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little\\nthe largest.\\n\\nHis first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's\\nshould be finished there--that the same party should be collected,\\nand the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.\\nWeston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston\\nmost willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;\\nand the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who\\nthere would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space\\nto every couple.\\n\\n\"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\\nCoxes five,\" had been repeated many times over. \"And there will be the\\ntwo Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.\\nYes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and\\nMiss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five\\ncouple there will be plenty of room.\"\\n\\nBut soon it came to be on one side,\\n\\n\"But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think\\nthere will.\"\\n\\nOn another,\\n\\n\"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to\\nstand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.\\nIt will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as the\\nthought of the moment.\"\\n\\nSomebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother's, and\\nmust be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert\\nwould have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was\\nput in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family\\nof cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance\\nwho could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple\\nwould be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what\\npossible manner they could be disposed of.\\n\\nThe doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. \"Might not\\nthey use both rooms, and dance across the passage?\" It seemed the\\nbest scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a\\nbetter. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about\\nthe supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of\\nhealth. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be\\npersevered in.\\n\\n\"Oh! no,\" said he; \"it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not\\nbear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.\\nSo would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would\\nbe quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do\\nnot let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very\\nthoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite\\nthe thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening,\\nand keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the\\ndraught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not\\nquite the thing!\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of\\nit, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now\\nclosed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only\\nin the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on\\nFrank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before\\nhad been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured\\nto be made out quite enough for ten.\\n\\n\"We were too magnificent,\" said he. \"We allowed unnecessary room. Ten\\ncouple may stand here very well.\"\\n\\nEmma demurred. \"It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be\\nworse than dancing without space to turn in?\"\\n\\n\"Very true,\" he gravely replied; \"it was very bad.\" But still he went on\\nmeasuring, and still he ended with,\\n\\n\"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" said she, \"you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful\\nto be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be\\ndancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!\"\\n\\n\"There is no denying it,\" he replied. \"I agree with you exactly. A crowd\\nin a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures\\nin a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however, having\\nproceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It would be\\na disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do not know that--I am\\nrather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well.\"\\n\\nEmma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\\nself-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of\\ndancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.\\nHad she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to\\npause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,\\nand the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their\\nacquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\\n\\nBefore the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\\nthe room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of\\nthe scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" he almost immediately began, \"your inclination\\nfor dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors\\nof my father's little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a\\nthought of my father's, which waits only your approbation to be acted\\nupon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances\\nof this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the\\nCrown Inn?\"\\n\\n\"The Crown!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,\\nmy father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.\\nBetter accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful\\nwelcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees no\\nobjection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel.\\nOh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the Randalls\\nrooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you\\nwere the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_\\nto like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--I hope you\\nconsent?\"\\n\\n\"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.\\nWeston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for\\nmyself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement that could\\nbe. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?\"\\n\\nShe was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\\ncomprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were\\nnecessary to make it acceptable.\\n\\n\"No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--much\\nworse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;\\nnever properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they\\nhad better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the Crown\\nin his life--did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a\\nvery bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.\"\\n\\n\"I was going to observe, sir,\" said Frank Churchill, \"that one of the\\ngreat recommendations of this change would be the very little danger\\nof any body's catching cold--so much less danger at the Crown than at\\nRandalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but\\nnobody else could.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, \"you are very much mistaken\\nif you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is\\nextremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how\\nthe room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house.\"\\n\\n\"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no\\noccasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and it\\nis that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon\\nheated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.\"\\n\\n\"Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of\\nopening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never\\nheard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!--I am sure, neither\\nyour father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a\\nwindow-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have\\noften known it done myself.\"\\n\\n\"Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I\\nlive out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,\\nthis does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it\\nover--but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One\\ncannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so\\nobliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what\\ncan be done.\"\\n\\n\"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" interrupted Emma, \"there will be plenty of time for talking every\\nthing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at\\nthe Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will be\\nso near their own stable.\"\\n\\n\"So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever\\ncomplains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could\\nbe sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is Mrs. Stokes to be\\ntrusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.\"\\n\\n\"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be\\nunder Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.\"\\n\\n\"There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who\\nis carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many\\nyears ago, when I had the measles? 'If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to\\nwrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' How often have I\\nheard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!\"\\n\\n\"Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor\\nlittle Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have\\nbeen very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He came four times a day\\nfor a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort--which\\nwas our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope\\nwhenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send for\\nPerry.\"\\n\\n\"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,\" said Frank\\nChurchill, \"examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there\\nand came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you\\nmight be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was\\ndesired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to\\nthem, if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing\\nsatisfactorily without you.\"\\n\\nEmma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\\nengaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people\\nset off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.\\nWeston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and\\nvery happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and he,\\nfinding every thing perfect.\\n\\n\"Emma,\" said she, \"this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places\\nyou see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and\\nforlorn than any thing I could have imagined.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you are too particular,\" said her husband. \"What does all that\\nsignify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as\\nclean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our\\nclub-nights.\"\\n\\nThe ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, \"Men never know\\nwhen things are dirty or not;\" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to\\nhimself, \"Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares.\"\\n\\nOne perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.\\nIt regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's being built,\\nsuppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was\\nthe only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted\\nas a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary\\nby their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable\\nsupper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the\\npurpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward\\npassage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.\\nWeston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage;\\nand neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being\\nmiserably crowded at supper.\\n\\nMrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,\\n&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched\\nsuggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was\\npronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and\\nMrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of\\nexpediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\\n\\n\"I do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.\"\\n\\nAnd Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through\\nthe passage, was calling out,\\n\\n\"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a\\nmere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.\"\\n\\n\"I wish,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"one could know which arrangement our guests\\nin general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing\\nmust be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very true,\" cried Frank, \"very true. You want your neighbours'\\nopinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief\\nof them--the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call\\nupon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.--And I do not know\\nwhether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of\\nthe rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger council.\\nSuppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?\"\\n\\n\"Well--if you please,\" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, \"if you think\\nshe will be of any use.\"\\n\\n\"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,\" said Emma. \"She\\nwill be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She\\nwill not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting\\nMiss Bates.\"\\n\\n\"But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing\\nMiss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.\"\\n\\nHere Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it\\nhis decided approbation.\\n\\n\"Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at\\nonce. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a properer\\nperson for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss Bates.\\nWe are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of how to be\\nhappy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.\"\\n\\n\"Both sir! Can the old lady?\"...\\n\\n\"The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great\\nblockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.\\nUndoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.\" And\\naway he ran.\\n\\nLong before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,\\nand her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and\\na good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it\\nmuch less than she had supposed before--indeed very trifling; and here\\nended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation at\\nleast, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and\\nchair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left\\nas mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.\\nStokes.--Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already\\nwritten to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\\nwhich could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to\\nbe.\\n\\nMost cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.\\nAs a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer\\ncharacter,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general\\nand minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another\\nhalf-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms,\\nsome suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the\\nfuture. The party did not break up without Emma's being positively\\nsecured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without\\nher overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, \"He has asked her, my\\ndear. That's right. I knew he would!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nOne thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely\\nsatisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within the granted\\nterm of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's\\nconfidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the\\nChurchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his\\nfortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take\\ntheir time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were\\nentered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and\\nhoping in uncertainty--at the risk--in her opinion, the great risk, of\\nits being all in vain.\\n\\nEnscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His\\nwish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed.\\nAll was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude\\ngenerally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of her\\nball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provoking\\nindifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, or\\nbecause the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he\\nseemed resolved that it should not interest him, determined against its\\nexciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.\\nTo her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,\\nthan,\\n\\n\"Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this\\ntrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say\\nagainst it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--Oh! yes,\\nI must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as\\nI can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's\\nweek's account; much rather, I confess.--Pleasure in seeing\\ndancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--I do not know who\\ndoes.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.\\nThose who are standing by are usually thinking of something very\\ndifferent.\"\\n\\nThis Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was not\\nin compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so\\nindignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball,\\nfor _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. It made\\nher animated--open hearted--she voluntarily said;--\\n\\n\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.\\nWhat a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with\\n_very_ great pleasure.\"\\n\\nIt was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred\\nthe society of William Larkins. No!--she was more and more convinced\\nthat Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There was a great\\ndeal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side--but no\\nlove.\\n\\nAlas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two\\ndays of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of\\nevery thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew's\\ninstant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell--far too unwell to do without\\nhim; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband)\\nwhen writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usual\\nunwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of\\nherself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle,\\nand must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.\\n\\nThe substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.\\nWeston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone\\nwithin a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt,\\nto lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred but\\nfor her own convenience.\\n\\nMrs. Weston added, \"that he could only allow himself time to hurry to\\nHighbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there\\nwhom he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be\\nexpected at Hartfield very soon.\"\\n\\nThis wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once it had\\nbeen read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The\\nloss of the ball--the loss of the young man--and all that the young man\\nmight be feeling!--It was too wretched!--Such a delightful evening as\\nit would have been!--Every body so happy! and she and her partner the\\nhappiest!--\"I said it would be so,\" was the only consolation.\\n\\nHer father's feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of\\nMrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and as\\nfor the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they\\nwould all be safer at home.\\n\\nEmma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this\\nreflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total want\\nof spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going away\\nalmost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He\\nsat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing\\nhimself, it was only to say,\\n\\n\"Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.\"\\n\\n\"But you will come again,\" said Emma. \"This will not be your only visit\\nto Randalls.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able to\\nreturn!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object of\\nall my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town this\\nspring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--I am afraid it\\nis a custom gone for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Our poor ball must be quite given up.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the\\npleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,\\nfoolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhy are you always so right?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much\\nrather have been merry than wise.\"\\n\\n\"If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends\\non it. Do not forget your engagement.\"\\n\\nEmma looked graciously.\\n\\n\"Such a fortnight as it has been!\" he continued; \"every day more\\nprecious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making\\nme less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at\\nHighbury!\"\\n\\n\"As you do us such ample justice now,\" said Emma, laughing, \"I will\\nventure to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?\\nDo not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure\\nyou did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in\\ncoming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.\"\\n\\nHe laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma\\nwas convinced that it had been so.\\n\\n\"And you must be off this very morning?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I\\nmust be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bring\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss\\nBates? How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind might have\\nstrengthened yours.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It\\nwas a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained\\nby Miss Bates's being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not\\nto wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one _must_\\nlaugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my\\nvisit, then\"--\\n\\nHe hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\\n\\n\"In short,\" said he, \"perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hardly be\\nquite without suspicion\"--\\n\\nHe looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew\\nwhat to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely\\nserious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in\\nthe hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\\n\\n\"You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,\\nthen\"--\\n\\nHe was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\\non what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard\\nhim sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh.\\nHe could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments\\npassed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,\\n\\n\"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to\\nHartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm\"--\\n\\nHe stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--He was more\\nin love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might\\nhave ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse\\nsoon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.\\n\\nA very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.\\nWeston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of\\nprocrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that\\nwas doubtful, said, \"It was time to go;\" and the young man, though he\\nmight and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.\\n\\n\"I shall hear about you all,\" said he; \"that is my chief consolation.\\nI shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged\\nMrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise\\nit. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really\\ninterested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing. In her letters\\nI shall be at dear Highbury again.\"\\n\\nA very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest \"Good-bye,\" closed the\\nspeech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had been\\nthe notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so sorry\\nto part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his\\nabsence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too\\nmuch.\\n\\nIt was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his\\narrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to\\nthe last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation\\nof seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his\\nattentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy\\nfortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common\\ncourse of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he had\\n_almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what constancy of\\naffection he might be subject to, was another point; but at present\\nshe could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious\\npreference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest,\\nmade her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of\\nevery previous determination against it.\\n\\n\"I certainly must,\" said she. \"This sensation of listlessness,\\nweariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,\\nthis feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!--\\nI must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I\\nwere not--for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always good to\\nothers. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for Frank\\nChurchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the evening\\nwith his dear William Larkins now if he likes.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not say\\nthat he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have\\ncontradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he\\nwas sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable\\nkindness added,\\n\\n\"You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out\\nof luck; you are very much out of luck!\"\\n\\nIt was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest\\nregret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure\\nwas odious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from\\nheadache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball\\ntaken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was\\ncharity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of\\nill-health.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nEmma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas\\nonly varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good\\ndeal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing\\nFrank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever\\nin seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him, and\\nquite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how were\\nhis spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his coming to\\nRandalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could not admit\\nherself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be less disposed\\nfor employment than usual; she was still busy and cheerful; and,\\npleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have faults; and\\nfarther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat drawing or\\nworking, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close\\nof their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing\\nelegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his\\nside was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection was always to subside\\ninto friendship. Every thing tender and charming was to mark their\\nparting; but still they were to part. When she became sensible of this,\\nit struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of\\nher previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never\\nto marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle\\nthan she could foresee in her own feelings.\\n\\n\"I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,\" said\\nshe.--\"In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is\\nthere any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not\\nreally necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will\\nnot persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love. I\\nshould be sorry to be more.\"\\n\\nUpon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.\\n\\n\"_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very\\nmuch in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection\\ncontinue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most\\ninexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I\\nimagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he\\nhad believed me at all to share his feelings, he would not have been\\nso wretched. Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and\\nlanguage at parting would have been different.--Still, however, I must\\nbe on my guard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing\\nwhat it now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look\\nupon him to be quite the sort of man--I do not altogether build upon\\nhis steadiness or constancy.--His feelings are warm, but I can imagine\\nthem rather changeable.--Every consideration of the subject, in short,\\nmakes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I\\nshall do very well again after a little while--and then, it will be a\\ngood thing over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives,\\nand I shall have been let off easily.\"\\n\\nWhen his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and\\nshe read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her\\nat first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had\\nundervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving\\nthe particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the\\naffection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable,\\nand describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed\\nattractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of\\napology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.\\nWeston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\\nbetween the places in some of the first blessings of social life was\\njust enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more\\nmight have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm\\nof her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than\\nonce, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a\\ncompliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in\\nthe very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by any\\nsuch broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of\\nher influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all\\nconveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these\\nwords--\"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss\\nWoodhouse's beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus\\nto her.\" This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was\\nremembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospects\\nas to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;\\nMrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own\\nimagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.\\n\\nGratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material\\npart, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned\\nto Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could\\nstill do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her.\\nHer intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew more\\ninteresting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation\\nand happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words which\\nclothed it, the \"beautiful little friend,\" suggested to her the\\nidea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections. Was it\\nimpossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in\\nunderstanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness\\nof her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the\\nprobabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For\\nHarriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\\n\\n\"I must not dwell upon it,\" said she.--\"I must not think of it. I know\\nthe danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have\\nhappened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it\\nwill be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested\\nfriendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.\"\\n\\nIt was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though it\\nmight be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter\\nwas at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton's\\nengagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest\\nhad entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill's\\ndisappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible\\nform.--His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among them again; Mr.\\nElton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over the first letter\\nfrom Enscombe before \"Mr. Elton and his bride\" was in every body's\\nmouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the sound.\\nShe had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's\\nmind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength.\\nWith Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of\\ninsensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she had\\nnot attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual\\napproach--new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.\\n\\nPoor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\\nreasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could\\ngive. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet had\\na right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy work\\nto be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreed\\nto, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet listened\\nsubmissively, and said \"it was very true--it was just as Miss Woodhouse\\ndescribed--it was not worth while to think about them--and she would not\\nthink about them any longer\" but no change of subject could avail, and\\nthe next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as\\nbefore. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.\\n\\n\"Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.\\nElton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.\\nYou could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into.\\nIt was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure\\nyou.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--and it will\\nbe a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of\\nforgetting it.\"\\n\\nHarriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager\\nexclamation. Emma continued,\\n\\n\"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk\\nless of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I\\nwould wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my\\ncomfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is your\\nduty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of\\nothers, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity.\\nThese are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are very\\nimportant--and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act\\nupon them. My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.\\nI want you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes\\nhave felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather what\\nwould be kind by me.\"\\n\\nThis appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of\\nwanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really\\nloved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence\\nof grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to\\nwhat was right and support her in it very tolerably.\\n\\n\"You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--Want\\ngratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do\\nfor you!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!\"\\n\\nSuch expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and\\nmanner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so\\nwell, nor valued her affection so highly before.\\n\\n\"There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,\" said she afterwards to\\nherself. \"There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and tenderness\\nof heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the\\nclearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. It\\nis tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally\\nbeloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--I have it not--but\\nI know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all the\\ncharm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!--I would not change\\nyou for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female\\nbreathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a\\nhundred such--And for a wife--a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable. I\\nmention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nMrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be\\ninterrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and\\nit must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to\\nsettle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or\\nnot pretty at all.\\n\\nEmma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make\\nher resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a\\npoint of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of the business might\\nbe gone through as soon as possible.\\n\\nShe could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to\\nwhich she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to\\nlace up her boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts\\nwould recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was\\nnot to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but\\nshe behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The visit\\nwas of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation\\nof mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to\\nform an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the\\nnothing-meaning terms of being \"elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.\"\\n\\nShe did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\\nbut she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--\\nShe was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there\\nwas too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty;\\nbut neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma\\nthought at least it would turn out so.\\n\\nAs for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would not\\npermit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was an\\nawkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man\\nhad need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman\\nwas better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the\\nprivilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to\\ndepend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.\\nElton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just\\nmarried, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had\\nbeen expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as\\nlittle wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as\\ncould be.\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" said Harriet, when they had quitted the\\nhouse, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; \"Well, Miss\\nWoodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--Is not she\\nvery charming?\"\\n\\nThere was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.\"\\n\\n\"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.\"\\n\\n\"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.\"\\n\\n\"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and\\nshe came in his way.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say,\" returned Harriet, sighing again, \"I dare say she was very\\nmuch attached to him.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman\\nwho loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this\\nthe best offer she was likely to have.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harriet earnestly, \"and well she might, nobody could ever\\nhave a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss\\nWoodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as\\nsuperior as ever;--but being married, you know, it is quite a different\\nthing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit and\\nadmire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not thrown\\nhimself away, is such a comfort!--She does seem a charming young woman,\\njust what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her 'Augusta.' How\\ndelightful!\"\\n\\nWhen the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see\\nmore and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield,\\nand her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter\\nof an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could composedly\\nattend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that\\nMrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and\\nthinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be very\\nsuperior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert\\nand familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people,\\nand one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that\\nher society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.\\n\\nHarriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,\\nshe would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it\\nmight be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of\\nher own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the\\nalliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.\\n\\nThe very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, \"My brother\\nMr. Suckling's seat;\"--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The\\ngrounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was\\nmodern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed\\nby the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or\\nimagine. \"Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the\\nlikeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room\\nat Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room.\"--Mr. Elton was appealed\\nto.--\"Was not it astonishingly like?--She could really almost fancy\\nherself at Maple Grove.\"\\n\\n\"And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the\\nstaircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really\\ncould not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very\\ndelightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to\\nas Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a little\\nsigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body who\\nsees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home.\\nWhenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will\\nunderstand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like\\nwhat one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils of\\nmatrimony.\"\\n\\nEmma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\\nfor Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\\n\\n\"So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house--the\\ngrounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.\\nThe laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand\\nvery much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse\\nof a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in\\nmind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People\\nwho have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing\\nin the same style.\"\\n\\nEmma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that\\npeople who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the\\nextensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack\\nan error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,\\n\\n\"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you\\nhave overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you\\nknow. Surry is the garden of England.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many\\ncounties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as\\nSurry.\"\\n\\n\"No, I fancy not,\" replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.\\n\"I never heard any county but Surry called so.\"\\n\\nEmma was silenced.\\n\\n\"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer\\nat farthest,\" continued Mrs. Elton; \"and that will be our time for\\nexploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare\\nsay. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four\\nperfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_ carriage,\\nwe should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well. They\\nwould hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the\\nyear. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their\\nbringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable.\\nWhen people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss\\nWoodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr.\\nSuckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King's-Weston\\ntwice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their\\nfirst having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind\\nhere, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?\"\\n\\n\"No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very\\nstriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we\\nare a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home\\nthan engage in schemes of pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can\\nbe more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple\\nGrove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol,\\n'I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must\\ngo in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau\\nwithout a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will,\\nwould never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a time has she said so;\\nand yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary,\\nwhen people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very\\nbad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in\\na proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. I\\nperfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--(looking\\ntowards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must be a great\\ndrawback. Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should. Let me recommend\\nBath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse\\ngood.\"\\n\\n\"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any\\nbenefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,\\ndoes not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the\\nwaters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath\\nlife, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,\\nthat it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits,\\nwhich, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its\\nrecommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell\\non them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally\\nunderstood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived\\nso secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best\\nsociety in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of\\nacquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have\\nalways resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any\\nattentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public\\nwith.\"\\n\\nIt was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea\\nof her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an\\n_introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend\\nof Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the\\nhelp of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of Miss\\nWoodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\\n\\nShe restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have\\ngiven, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; \"but their going to Bath was\\nquite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that\\nthe place might suit her better than her father.\" And then, to prevent\\nfarther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.\\n\\n\"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions,\\na lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long known\\nthat you are a superior performer.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior\\nperformer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial\\na quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of\\nmusic--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid\\nof taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is\\n_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play\\ndelightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,\\ncomfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got\\ninto. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to\\nme; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\\nMaple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I\\nhonestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future\\nhome, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\\ndisagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had\\nbeen accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\\nWhen he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\\n_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of\\nretirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was\\nnot necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who had\\nno resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite\\nindependent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I\\nreally could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any\\nsacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every\\nluxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were not\\nnecessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. 'But,' said I,\\n'to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a\\nmusical society. I condition for nothing else; but without music, life\\nwould be a blank to me.'\"\\n\\n\"We cannot suppose,\" said Emma, smiling, \"that Mr. Elton would hesitate\\nto assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and\\nI hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be\\npardoned, in consideration of the motive.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to\\nfind myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little\\nconcerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a\\nmusical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.\\nWill not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall\\nnot be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be\\nparticularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in\\npractice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against\\nthem, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.\"\\n\\n\"But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger,\\nsurely?\"\\n\\n\"I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,\\nI tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--never touches the\\ninstrument--though she played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs.\\nJeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs.\\nBird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my\\nword it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with\\nSelina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has\\nmany things to call her attention. I believe I was half an hour this\\nmorning shut up with my housekeeper.\"\\n\\n\"But every thing of that kind,\" said Emma, \"will soon be in so regular a\\ntrain--\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Elton, laughing, \"we shall see.\"\\n\\nEmma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing\\nmore to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose another\\nsubject.\\n\\n\"We have been calling at Randalls,\" said she, \"and found them both at\\nhome; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.\\nMr. Weston seems an excellent creature--quite a first-rate favourite\\nwith me already, I assure you. And _she_ appears so truly good--there is\\nsomething so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one\\ndirectly. She was your governess, I think?\"\\n\\nEmma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly\\nwaited for the affirmative before she went on.\\n\\n\"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very\\nlady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Weston's manners,\" said Emma, \"were always particularly good.\\nTheir propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\\nmodel for any young woman.\"\\n\\n\"And who do you think came in while we were there?\"\\n\\nEmma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance--and\\nhow could she possibly guess?\\n\\n\"Knightley!\" continued Mrs. Elton; \"Knightley himself!--Was not it\\nlucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never\\nseen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s,\\nI had a great curiosity. 'My friend Knightley' had been so often\\nmentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my\\ncaro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend.\\nKnightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much. Decidedly, I\\nthink, a very gentleman-like man.\"\\n\\nHappily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could\\nbreathe.\\n\\n\"Insufferable woman!\" was her immediate exclamation. \"Worse than I had\\nsupposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!--I could not have\\nbelieved it. Knightley!--never seen him in her life before, and call\\nhim Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,\\nvulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her\\nresources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.\\nActually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether\\nhe will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could\\nnot have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to\\nform a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.\\nWeston!--Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a\\ngentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond\\nmy hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank\\nChurchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted he\\nwould be! Ah! there I am--thinking of him directly. Always the first\\nperson to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes\\nas regularly into my mind!\"--\\n\\nAll this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her father\\nhad arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure, and was\\nready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" he deliberately began, \"considering we never saw her\\nbefore, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she\\nwas very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little\\nquickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe\\nI am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and\\npoor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved\\nyoung lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think\\nhe had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not\\nhaving been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I\\nsaid that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought to\\nhave gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it shews\\nwhat a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage\\nLane.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes: but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects to her\\nif possible. It was being very deficient.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why\\nshould you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to\\nbe no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you\\nmake so much of them.\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always\\nwish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride, especially,\\nis never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, you\\nknow, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who\\nthey may.\"\\n\\n\"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what\\nis. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to\\nsuch vanity-baits for poor young ladies.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere\\ncommon politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any\\nencouragement to people to marry.\"\\n\\nEmma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand\\n_her_. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very long,\\ndid they occupy her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nEmma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\\nopinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as\\nMrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared\\nwhenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,\\nand ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment,\\nbut so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior\\nknowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;\\nand conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.\\nElton's consequence only could surpass.\\n\\nThere was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from\\nhis wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had the air\\nof congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury,\\nas not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her\\nnew acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging,\\nfollowing the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for granted\\nthat the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed\\nherself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praise\\npassed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss\\nWoodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked with\\na good grace of her being \"very pleasant and very elegantly dressed.\"\\n\\nIn one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at\\nfirst. Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, by the\\nlittle encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew\\nback in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and\\nthough the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was\\nnecessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Her manners, too--and Mr.\\nElton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and\\nnegligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but the\\nsensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very\\nmuch.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had been\\nan offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story, under\\na colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him,\\nhad in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, the object\\nof their joint dislike.--When they had nothing else to say, it must be\\nalways easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which\\nthey dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in\\ncontemptuous treatment of Harriet.\\n\\nMrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not\\nmerely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to\\nrecommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied\\nwith expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--but without\\nsolicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and\\nbefriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the\\nthird time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry\\non the subject.--\\n\\n\"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave\\nabout Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and\\nladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very\\nextraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely\\nwell. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she\\nis absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth--but, upon my word,\\nI talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--And her situation is so calculated\\nto affect one!--Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour\\nto do something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers\\nmust not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those\\ncharming lines of the poet,\\n\\n        'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\\n          'And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'\\n\\nWe must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot think there is any danger of it,\" was Emma's calm answer--\"and\\nwhen you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation and\\nunderstand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I\\nhave no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such\\nobscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed\\nwith the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.\\nI am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she\\nfeels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I\\nmust confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for\\ntimidity--and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those\\nwho are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure\\nyou, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more\\nthan I can express.\"\\n\\n\"You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any of\\nMiss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known her longer\\nthan yourself, can shew her any other attention than\"--\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to\\nact. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will\\nfollow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_\\nhave carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style\\nwhich could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the\\nleast inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to\\nsend us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_\\nthan Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of\\nthing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been\\nused to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\\nother way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple\\nGrove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--for we do not\\nat all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.--However, my\\nresolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--I shall certainly have\\nher very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall\\nhave musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly\\non the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very\\nextensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit\\nher shortly.--I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my\\nbrother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her\\nextremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears\\nwill completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners\\nof either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often\\nindeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a\\nseat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Jane Fairfax!\"--thought Emma.--\"You have not deserved this. You\\nmay have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment\\nbeyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs.\\nElton!--'Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens! Let me not suppose\\nthat she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--But upon my honour,\\nthere seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman's tongue!\"\\n\\nEmma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively\\naddressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a \"dear Miss\\nWoodhouse.\" The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared,\\nand she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular\\nfriend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very active\\npatroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general\\nway, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\\n\\nShe looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for\\nMrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless\\nsimplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies--the\\nmost amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished and\\ncondescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's only surprize\\nwas that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs.\\nElton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with the Eltons,\\nsitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! This was\\nastonishing!--She could not have believed it possible that the taste or\\nthe pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as\\nthe Vicarage had to offer.\\n\\n\"She is a riddle, quite a riddle!\" said she.--\"To chuse to remain here\\nmonth after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the\\nmortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of her conversation,\\nrather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her\\nwith such real, generous affection.\"\\n\\nJane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\\nwere gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had\\npromised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh\\ninvitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to Miss\\nBates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.\\nWould Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends\\ncontrived--no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had\\ndeclined it!\\n\\n\"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\\nthis invitation,\" was Emma's conclusion. \"She must be under some sort\\nof penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is great\\nfear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--She is _not_ to be\\nwith the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must she\\nconsent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle.\"\\n\\nUpon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before\\nthe few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this\\napology for Jane.\\n\\n\"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,\\nmy dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a\\ngood creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We\\nmust consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for\\nwhat she goes to.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"Miss Fairfax\\nis as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\nCould she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen\\nher. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions from\\nMrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.\"\\n\\nEmma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she\\nwas herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently\\nreplied,\\n\\n\"Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, would rather\\ndisgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations I should\\nhave imagined any thing but inviting.\"\\n\\n\"I should not wonder,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"if Miss Fairfax were to have\\nbeen drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness in\\naccepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may\\nvery likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\\nappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in\\nspite of the very natural wish of a little change.\"\\n\\nBoth felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\\nminutes silence, he said,\\n\\n\"Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton does\\nnot talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her. We all know the\\ndifference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken\\namongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common\\ncivility in our personal intercourse with each other--a something more\\nearly implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we\\nmay have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.\\nAnd besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be\\nsure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind\\nand manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the\\nrespect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably\\nnever fell in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can\\nprevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if\\nnot in consciousness.\"\\n\\n\"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,\" said Emma. Little Henry\\nwas in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her\\nirresolute what else to say.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"any body may know how highly I think of her.\"\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon\\nstopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--she hurried\\non--\"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it\\nis. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or\\nother.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\\nleather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or\\nsome other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\\n\\n\"Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me\\na hint of it six weeks ago.\"\\n\\nHe stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not\\nherself know what to think. In a moment he went on--\\n\\n\"That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare\\nsay, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very sure I shall\\nnever ask her.\"\\n\\nEmma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased\\nenough to exclaim,\\n\\n\"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.\"\\n\\nHe seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner which\\nshewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,\\n\\n\"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?\"\\n\\n\"No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making,\\nfor me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now,\\nmeant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any\\nidea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest\\nwish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come\\nin and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, \"No,\\nEmma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take\\nme by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure\\nyou.\" And soon afterwards, \"Jane Fairfax is a very charming young\\nwoman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has\\nnot the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.\"\\n\\nEmma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. \"Well,\" said\\nshe, \"and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\\nhe asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or\\nwittier than his neighbours.\"\\n\\n\"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and\\nwittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--what\\nshe calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough\\nin familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley--what can she do for\\nMr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts\\nher civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument\\nweighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation\\nof getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of\\nMiss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's\\nacknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her\\nbeing under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.\\nI cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\\nwith praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\\ncontinually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring her\\na permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring\\nparties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.\"\\n\\n\"Jane Fairfax has feeling,\" said Mr. Knightley--\"I do not accuse her\\nof want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong--and her\\ntemper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;\\nbut it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than\\nshe used to be--And I love an open temper. No--till Cole alluded to my\\nsupposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax\\nand conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no\\nthought beyond.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Mrs. Weston,\" said Emma triumphantly when he left them, \"what do\\nyou say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?\"\\n\\n\"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the\\nidea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it\\nwere to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nEvery body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was\\ndisposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and\\nevening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed\\nin so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were\\nnever to have a disengaged day.\\n\\n\"I see how it is,\" said she. \"I see what a life I am to lead among you.\\nUpon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite\\nthe fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very\\nformidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a\\ndisengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have\\nbeen at a loss.\"\\n\\nNo invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties\\nperfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for\\ndinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at\\nthe poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury\\ncard-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a\\ngood deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew\\nthem how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the spring\\nshe must return their civilities by one very superior party--in which\\nher card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and\\nunbroken packs in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the\\nevening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the\\nrefreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\\n\\nEmma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at\\nHartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she\\nshould be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful\\nresentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for\\nten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the\\nusual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,\\nwith the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.\\n\\nThe persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the\\nEltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of\\ncourse--and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\\nbe asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with\\nequal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased\\nby Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it. \"She would rather not\\nbe in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite\\nable to see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling\\nuncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would\\nrather stay at home.\" It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had\\nshe deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was delighted with the\\nfortitude of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to\\ngive up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\\nvery person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--\\nSince her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she\\nwas more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often\\nbeen.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane\\nFairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.\\n\\n\"This is very true,\" said she, \"at least as far as relates to me, which\\nwas all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--and\\nalways knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--She will\\nnever like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew her\\ngreater attention than I have done.\"\\n\\nEvery invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all\\nhappy.--The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet\\nover. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little\\nKnightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some\\nweeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and\\nstaying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very day\\nof this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his being\\nput off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening\\nso. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the\\nutmost that his nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emma\\napprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not\\nbeing able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without\\nfalling in with a dinner-party.\\n\\nShe comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by\\nrepresenting that though he certainly would make them nine, yet\\nhe always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very\\nimmaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to\\nhave him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her\\ninstead of his brother.\\n\\nThe event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John\\nKnightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and\\nmust be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in the\\nevening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;\\nand the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the\\nphilosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the\\nchief of even Emma's vexation.\\n\\nThe day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John\\nKnightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being\\nagreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they\\nwaited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton,\\nas elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in\\nsilence--wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but\\nMiss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk\\nto her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk\\nwith his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It was\\nnatural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,\\n\\n\"I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am\\nsure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time. I hope you\\nturned directly.\"\\n\\n\"I went only to the post-office,\" said she, \"and reached home before the\\nrain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when\\nI am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A walk\\nbefore breakfast does me good.\"\\n\\n\"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.\"\\n\\n\"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.\"\\n\\nMr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\\n\\n\"That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards\\nfrom your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry\\nand John had seen more drops than they could count long before. The\\npost-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you have\\nlived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going\\nthrough the rain for.\"\\n\\nThere was a little blush, and then this answer,\\n\\n\"I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every\\ndearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing\\nolder should make me indifferent about letters.\"\\n\\n\"Indifferent! Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.\\nLetters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\\npositive curse.\"\\n\\n\"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of\\nfriendship.\"\\n\\n\"I have often thought them the worst of the two,\" replied he coolly.\\n\"Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well--I am\\nvery sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I\\ncan easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than\\nto me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which\\nmakes the difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every\\nbody dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again;\\nand therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office,\\nI think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than\\nto-day.\"\\n\\n\"When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,\"\\nsaid John Knightley, \"I meant to imply the change of situation which\\ntime usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time will\\ngenerally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily\\ncircle--but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an old\\nfriend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence\\nyou may have as many concentrated objects as I have.\"\\n\\nIt was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant \"thank\\nyou\" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear\\nin the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was\\nnow claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on such\\noccasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his particular\\ncompliments to the ladies, was ending with her--and with all his mildest\\nurbanity, said,\\n\\n\"I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning\\nin the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.--Young ladies\\nare delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their\\ncomplexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\\nsolicitude about me.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--I\\nhope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very\\nold friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You\\ndo us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I\\nare both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest\\nsatisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.\"\\n\\nThe kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he\\nhad done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\\n\\nBy this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her\\nremonstrances now opened upon Jane.\\n\\n\"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office in the\\nrain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl, how could you do\\nsuch a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.\"\\n\\nJane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\\n\\n\"Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know\\nhow to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,\\ndid you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our\\nauthority.\"\\n\\n\"My advice,\" said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, \"I certainly do\\nfeel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--Liable\\nas you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly\\ncareful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think\\nrequires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even\\nhalf a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough\\nagain. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too\\nreasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing again.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,\" eagerly rejoined Mrs.\\nElton. \"We will not allow her to do such a thing again:\"--and nodding\\nsignificantly--\"there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.\\nI shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning\\n(one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and\\nbring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and from\\n_us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to accept\\nsuch an accommodation.\"\\n\\n\"You are extremely kind,\" said Jane; \"but I cannot give up my early\\nwalk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk\\nsomewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have\\nscarcely ever had a bad morning before.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is\\n(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing\\nwithout the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,\\nyou and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter\\nmyself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I\\nmeet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as\\nsettled.\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" said Jane earnestly, \"I cannot by any means consent to such\\nan arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the errand\\nwere not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am\\nnot here, by my grandmama's.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to\\nemploy our men.\"\\n\\nJane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of\\nanswering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\\n\\n\"The post-office is a wonderful establishment!\" said she.--\"The\\nregularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,\\nand all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!\"\\n\\n\"It is certainly very well regulated.\"\\n\\n\"So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that\\na letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the\\nkingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million, I suppose,\\nactually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad\\nhands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.\"\\n\\n\"The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some quickness\\nof sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther\\nexplanation,\" continued he, smiling, \"they are paid for it. That is\\nthe key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served\\nwell.\"\\n\\nThe varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\\nobservations made.\\n\\n\"I have heard it asserted,\" said John Knightley, \"that the same sort\\nof handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master\\nteaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine\\nthe likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very\\nlittle teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can\\nget. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I have not\\nalways known their writing apart.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said his brother hesitatingly, \"there is a likeness. I know what\\nyou mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest.\"\\n\\n\"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,\" said Mr. Woodhouse; \"and\\nalways did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston\"--with half a sigh and half a\\nsmile at her.\\n\\n\"I never saw any gentleman's handwriting\"--Emma began, looking also at\\nMrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending\\nto some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect, \"Now, how am\\nI going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once\\nbefore all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout\\nphrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that\\nwould be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce\\nhis name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and\\nbetter.--Now for it.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--\"Mr. Frank Churchill\\nwrites one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw.\"\\n\\n\"I do not admire it,\" said Mr. Knightley. \"It is too small--wants\\nstrength. It is like a woman's writing.\"\\n\\nThis was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against\\nthe base aspersion. \"No, it by no means wanted strength--it was not a\\nlarge hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston any\\nletter about her to produce?\" No, she had heard from him very lately,\\nbut having answered the letter, had put it away.\\n\\n\"If we were in the other room,\" said Emma, \"if I had my writing-desk, I\\nam sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.--Do not you\\nremember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?\"\\n\\n\"He chose to say he was employed\"--\\n\\n\"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince\\nMr. Knightley.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,\" said Mr.\\nKnightley dryly, \"writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will, of\\ncourse, put forth his best.\"\\n\\nDinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, was\\nready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be\\nallowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--\\n\\n\"Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.\"\\n\\nJane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\\nShe had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether\\nthe wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it\\n_had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full\\nexpectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been\\nin vain. She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual--a\\nglow both of complexion and spirits.\\n\\nShe could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the\\nexpense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue's end--but she\\nabstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt\\nJane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the\\nroom, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the\\nbeauty and grace of each.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found it\\nhardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--with so\\nmuch perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross\\nJane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to\\nbe almost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton\\nleft them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little time, she\\nsoon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a\\nhalf-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there was no avoiding\\na knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office--catching\\ncold--fetching letters--and friendship, were long under discussion;\\nand to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant\\nto Jane--inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to\\nsuit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.\\n\\n\"Here is April come!\" said she, \"I get quite anxious about you. June\\nwill soon be here.\"\\n\\n\"But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked\\nforward to the summer in general.\"\\n\\n\"But have you really heard of nothing?\"\\n\\n\"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the\\ndifficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.\"\\n\\n\"I not aware!\" said Jane, shaking her head; \"dear Mrs. Elton, who can\\nhave thought of it as I have done?\"\\n\\n\"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know\\nhow many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations. I saw\\na vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of\\nMr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every\\nbody was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first circle.\\nWax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all\\nhouses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see\\nyou in.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,\"\\nsaid Jane. \"I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want\\nit;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would\\nnot wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.\"\\n\\n\"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me\\ntrouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be\\nmore interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in\\na day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out\\nfor any thing eligible.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to\\nher; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body\\ntrouble.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,\\nor say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before\\nus. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve,\\nand your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence,\\nis not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin\\ninquiring directly.\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\\ninquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When\\nI am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being\\nlong unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry\\nwould soon produce something--Offices for the sale--not quite of human\\nflesh--but of human intellect.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at\\nthe slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to\\nthe abolition.\"\\n\\n\"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,\" replied Jane;\\n\"governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely\\ndifferent certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to\\nthe greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But\\nI only mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by\\napplying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with\\nsomething that would do.\"\\n\\n\"Something that would do!\" repeated Mrs. Elton. \"Aye, _that_ may suit\\nyour humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are;\\nbut it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any\\nthing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family\\nnot moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;\\nit would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I\\nthink, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.\\nA gentleman's family is all that I should condition for.\"\\n\\n\"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall\\nbe a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite\\non my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the\\nfirst circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name\\nyour own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family\\nas much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--if you knew the harp, you\\nmight do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;--yes, I\\nreally believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what\\nyou chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and\\ncomfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.\"\\n\\n\"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such\\na situation together,\" said Jane, \"they are pretty sure to be equal;\\nhowever, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted\\nat present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am\\nobliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing\\nnothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I\\nshall remain where I am, and as I am.\"\\n\\n\"And I am quite serious too, I assure you,\" replied Mrs. Elton gaily,\\n\"in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to\\nwatch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.\"\\n\\nIn this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr.\\nWoodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of object,\\nand Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,\\n\\n\"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his\\ngallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature\\nhe is;--I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint,\\nold-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;\\nmodern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish\\nyou had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I\\nbegan to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I\\nam rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like\\nit?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it\\nis not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being\\nover-trimmed--quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments\\nnow, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like\\na bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style\\nof dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the\\nminority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show\\nand finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a\\ntrimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will\\nlook well?\"\\n\\nThe whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.\\nWeston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a late dinner,\\nand walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too much\\nexpected by the best judges, for surprize--but there was great joy. Mr.\\nWoodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been sorry\\nto see him before. John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.--That\\na man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day\\nof business in London, should set off again, and walk half a mile\\nto another man's house, for the sake of being in mixed company till\\nbed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise\\nof numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A man who had been\\nin motion since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been\\nstill, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had\\nbeen in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man, to\\nquit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside, and on the\\nevening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!--Could\\nhe by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife, there\\nwould have been a motive; but his coming would probably prolong rather\\nthan break up the party. John Knightley looked at him with amazement,\\nthen shrugged his shoulders, and said, \"I could not have believed it\\neven of _him_.\"\\n\\nMr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was\\nexciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being\\nprincipal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was\\nmaking himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the\\ninquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all\\nher careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread\\nabroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a family\\ncommunication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he\\nhad not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in\\nthe room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he\\nhad met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.\\n\\n\"Read it, read it,\" said he, \"it will give you pleasure; only a few\\nlines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.\"\\n\\nThe two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking\\nto them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to\\nevery body.\\n\\n\"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say\\nto it?--I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?--Anne,\\nmy dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?--In\\ntown next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say; for _she_ is as\\nimpatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most\\nlikely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all\\nnothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us\\nagain, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come,\\nand he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted.\\nWell, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read\\nit all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some\\nother time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the\\ncircumstance to the others in a common way.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks\\nand words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was\\nhappy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm and\\nopen; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little occupied\\nin weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her\\nagitation, which she rather thought was considerable.\\n\\nMr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\\nto want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,\\nand soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\\ncommunication of what the whole room must have overheard already.\\n\\nIt was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he might\\nnot have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly\\ndelighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to\\nbe made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but\\nshe was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have\\nbeen too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.\\nElton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject\\nwith her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\n\"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,\"\\nsaid Mr. Weston.\\n\\nMrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her\\nby such a hope, smiled most graciously.\\n\\n\"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,\" he\\ncontinued--\"and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.\\nElton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great\\npleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.\"\\n\\n\"You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--\\nHe is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a\\nletter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my\\nson's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed to me--it\\nwas to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I\\nhardly ever get a letter.\"\\n\\n\"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.\\nWeston--(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A most\\ndangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours\\nfollow your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we\\nmarried women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh! Mr. Weston, I could\\nnot have believed it of you!\"\\n\\n\"Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.\\nElton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in a hurry,\\nmerely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all coming up to\\ntown directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she has not been well the\\nwhole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--so they are all to\\nmove southward without loss of time.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a\\nconsiderable journey.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than\\nfrom Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people\\nof large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.\\nSuckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me--but twice\\nin one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four\\nhorses.\"\\n\\n\"The evil of the distance from Enscombe,\" said Mr. Weston, \"is, that\\nMrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the\\nsofa for a week together. In Frank's last letter she complained, he\\nsaid, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\\nboth his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree of\\nweakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to\\nsleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word. Certainly,\\ndelicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You\\nmust grant me that.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my\\nown sex. I do indeed. I give you notice--You will find me a formidable\\nantagonist on that point. I always stand up for women--and I assure you,\\nif you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you\\nwould not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making incredible exertions to\\navoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her--and I believe I have\\ncaught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;\\nan excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine\\nlady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land\\nfor\"--\\n\\nMrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,\\n\\n\"Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure\\nyou. Do not run away with such an idea.\"\\n\\n\"Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough\\na fine lady as any body ever beheld.\"\\n\\nMrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.\\nIt was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was\\n_not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of\\nit;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr.\\nWeston went on.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--but\\nthis is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and\\ntherefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health\\nnow; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I would\\nnot say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs.\\nChurchill's illness.\"\\n\\n\"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath, or to\\nClifton?\" \"She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for\\nher. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now\\nbeen a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she\\nbegins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very\\nretired.\"\\n\\n\"Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from\\nthe road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You\\nseem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--And\\nMrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy\\nthat sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough in\\nherself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman cannot\\nhave too many resources--and I feel very thankful that I have so many\\nmyself as to be quite independent of society.\"\\n\\n\"Frank was here in February for a fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"So I remember to have heard. He will find an _addition_ to the society\\nof Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call\\nmyself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being\\nsuch a creature in the world.\"\\n\\nThis was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.\\nWeston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\\n\\n\"My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible.\\nNot heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately have been full\\nof very little else than Mrs. Elton.\"\\n\\nHe had done his duty and could return to his son.\\n\\n\"When Frank left us,\" continued he, \"it was quite uncertain when we\\nmight see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It has\\nbeen completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasion\\nhe would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn\\nup--but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully\\ndesponding. 'How could he contrive to come? And how could it be supposed\\nthat his uncle and aunt would spare him again?' and so forth--I always\\nfelt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see.\\nI have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things\\nare going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say to\\na certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because\\nthings did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity\\nwhich suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that\\nhe was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen's saffron robe\\nwould be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel those\\ngloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The carriage--we had\\ndisappointments about the carriage;--one morning, I remember, he came to\\nme quite in despair.\"\\n\\nShe was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\\nseized the opportunity of going on.\\n\\n\"You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill\\nis ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than\\nEnscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable\\nprospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--precisely the\\nseason of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at\\nthe longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and\\nnever too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best\\nof it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather;\\nthere always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we\\nintended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I\\ndo not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the\\nsort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or\\nto-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than\\nhaving him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the\\nstate of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be\\npleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally\\nthought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston's\\npartiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most\\ngratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.\"\\n\\n\"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion\\nwill be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.\\nFrank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one\\nof those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly\\nguided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shall\\njudge of him.--I am no flatterer.\"\\n\\nMr. Weston was musing.\\n\\n\"I hope,\" said he presently, \"I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.\\nChurchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but\\nthere are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to\\nspeak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant,\\nMrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have\\nmet with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid\\nto her. She was the instigator. Frank's mother would never have been\\nslighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride\\nis nothing to his wife's: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort\\nof pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless\\nand tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence! And what\\ninclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.\\nShe was nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman;\\nbut ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd\\nthem all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is\\nan upstart.\"\\n\\n\"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite\\na horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to\\npeople of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who\\nare such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give\\nthemselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them\\ndirectly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and\\nencumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs,\\nand expecting to be on a footing with the old established families.\\nA year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West\\nHall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came from\\nBirmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston.\\nOne has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is something\\ndireful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the\\nTupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and\\nyet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to\\nmy brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest\\nneighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven\\nyears a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him--I\\nbelieve, at least--I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed\\nthe purchase before his death.\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having\\nsaid all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.\\n\\nAfter tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.\\nWoodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,\\nand Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\\nlittle disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which\\nnobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of spirits\\nwhich would have made her prefer being silent.\\n\\nMr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to\\nleave them early the next day; and he soon began with--\\n\\n\"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the\\nboys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at full\\nlength there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than\\nher's, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to\\nrecommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"I rather hope to satisfy you both,\" said Emma, \"for I shall do all\\nin my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and\\nhappiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.\"\\n\\n\"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.\"\\n\\n\"That is very likely. You think so, do not you?\"\\n\\n\"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--or even\\nmay be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue to\\nincrease as much as they have done lately.\"\\n\\n\"Increase!\"\\n\\n\"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a\\ngreat difference in your way of life.\"\\n\\n\"Difference! No indeed I am not.\"\\n\\n\"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than\\nyou used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for only\\none day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--When did it happen\\nbefore, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing, and you\\nmix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought\\nan account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the\\nCrown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your\\ngoings-on, is very great.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said his brother quickly, \"it is Randalls that does it all.\"\\n\\n\"Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\\ninfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, that\\nHenry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I only beg\\nyou to send them home.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" cried Mr. Knightley, \"that need not be the consequence. Let them\\nbe sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" exclaimed Emma, \"you amuse me! I should like to know how\\nmany of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of\\nthe party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to\\nattend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine--what have\\nthey been? Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball talked of,\\nwhich never took place. I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John\\nKnightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at\\nonce here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to\\nMr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from\\nHartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I\\ncannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt\\nEmma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better\\nwith Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she\\nis absent one--and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself\\nor settling his accounts.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without\\ndifficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVOLUME III\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nA very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\\nnature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She\\nwas soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all\\napprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment had\\nreally subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--but\\nif he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the\\ntwo, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had\\ntaken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two\\nmonths should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before\\nher:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did\\nnot mean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be\\nincumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\\n\\nShe wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\\nThat would be so very painful a conclusion of their present\\nacquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something\\ndecisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a\\ncrisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil\\nstate.\\n\\nIt was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,\\nbefore she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's\\nfeelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been\\nimagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards. He rode down\\nfor a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came from\\nRandalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all her quick\\nobservation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how she\\nmust act. They met with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubt\\nof his great pleasure in seeing her. But she had an almost instant doubt\\nof his caring for her as he had done, of his feeling the same tenderness\\nin the same degree. She watched him well. It was a clear thing he was\\nless in love than he had been. Absence, with the conviction probably\\nof her indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable\\neffect.\\n\\nHe was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\\ndelighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and he\\nwas not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read\\nhis comparative difference. He was not calm; his spirits were evidently\\nfluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he was, it seemed\\na liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her belief\\non the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying\\naway to make other calls in Highbury. \"He had seen a group of old\\nacquaintance in the street as he passed--he had not stopped, he would\\nnot stop for more than a word--but he had the vanity to think they would\\nbe disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay longer\\nat Hartfield, he must hurry off.\" She had no doubt as to his being less\\nin love--but neither his agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed\\nlike a perfect cure; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a\\ndread of her returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting\\nhimself with her long.\\n\\nThis was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\\nHe was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented. His\\naunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at\\nRandall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was\\nto be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of no\\nservice to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was\\nreally ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it, at\\nRandalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he looked\\nback, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a\\nyear ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care\\nand medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have many\\nyears of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on, by all\\nhis father's doubts, to say that her complaints were merely imaginary,\\nor that she was as strong as ever.\\n\\nIt soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could\\nnot endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and\\nsuffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to Randalls\\ncommunicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to\\nRichmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of\\nan eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A\\nready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit\\nexpected from the change.\\n\\nEmma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\\nand seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months\\nbefore him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--for the\\nhouse was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote with\\nthe greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he\\ncould even wish.\\n\\nEmma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was\\nconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. She\\nhoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.\\n\\nMr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted.\\nIt was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be\\nreally having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to\\na young man?--An hour's ride. He would be always coming over. The\\ndifference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make\\nthe whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen\\nmiles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street--was\\na serious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be\\nspent in coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in\\nLondon; he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very\\ndistance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer!\\n\\nOne good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this\\nremoval,--the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before,\\nbut it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,\\nhowever, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and\\nvery soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from\\nFrank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change, and\\nthat he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at\\nany given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.\\n\\nMr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood\\nbetween the young people of Highbury and happiness.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.\\nMay was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to\\nspend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely\\nhoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any\\nthing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nNo misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,\\nthe day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank\\nChurchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls before\\ndinner, and every thing was safe.\\n\\nNo second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room\\nat the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a\\ncommon meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his\\nentreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,\\nfor the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of\\nthe rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse him,\\nand must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company.\\nShe was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the\\nRandalls party just sufficiently before them.\\n\\nFrank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not\\nsay much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.\\nThey all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should\\nbe; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another\\ncarriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great\\nsurprize. \"So unreasonably early!\" she was going to exclaim; but she\\npresently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming,\\nlike herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and\\nthey were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins,\\nwho had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing\\nearnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company\\nmight soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory\\ninspection.\\n\\nEmma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston\\ndepended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man\\nwho had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first\\ndistinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but\\na little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher\\ncharacter.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a\\nman what he ought to be.--She could fancy such a man. The whole party\\nwalked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing\\nelse to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe\\nin their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though\\n_May_, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.\\n\\nEmma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privy\\ncouncillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door\\nto offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be\\nbrought by the Eltons.\\n\\nFrank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\\nwhich shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to\\nthe door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatient\\nto begin, or afraid of being always near her.\\n\\nMrs. Elton was spoken of. \"I think she must be here soon,\" said he. \"I\\nhave a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.\\nIt cannot be long, I think, before she comes.\"\\n\\nA carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,\\nsaid,\\n\\n\"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen\\neither Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties\\npassed.\\n\\n\"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!\" said Mr. Weston, looking about. \"We\\nthought you were to bring them.\"\\n\\nThe mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma\\nlonged to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how\\nhe was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of\\ngraciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,\\nby giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.\\n\\nIn a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--\"I\\nwill see that there are umbrellas, sir,\" said Frank to his father:\\n\"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:\" and away he went. Mr. Weston was\\nfollowing; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion\\nof his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,\\nthough by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.\\n\\n\"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you\\nI should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely\\npleased with him.--You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him\\na very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and\\napprove--so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.\\nYou must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--quite a horror of them.\\nThey were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor\\nme had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very\\ncutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them\\nmuch better.\"\\n\\nWhile she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but\\nwhen she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies\\njust arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.\\n\\nMrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. \"I have no doubt of its being our\\ncarriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so\\nextremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--What\\na pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--I understand you\\nwere so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary.\\nYou may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into\\nthe room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.\\nWeston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be understood\\nby any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body's words,\\nwere soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in\\ntalking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her\\nbeing admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door opened she was\\nheard,\\n\\n\"So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not\\ncare for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares--Well!--(as soon\\nas she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!--This is\\nadmirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could\\nnot have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--Jane, Jane, look!--did you\\never see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's\\nlamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as\\nI came in; she was standing in the entrance. 'Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' said\\nI--but I had not time for more.\" She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--\"Very\\nwell, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear\\nit. So afraid you might have a headache!--seeing you pass by so often,\\nand knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed.\\nAh! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent\\ntime. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most\\ncomfortable carriage.--Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you,\\nMrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note,\\nor we should have been.--But two such offers in one day!--Never were\\nsuch neighbours. I said to my mother, 'Upon my word, ma'am--.' Thank\\nyou, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her\\ntake her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--\\nMrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!\\nBought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice. There were three\\nothers, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel\\nCampbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did\\nnot wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:--but\\nMr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--and there was a mat to step\\nupon--I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh! Mr. Frank\\nChurchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in\\nfault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of\\nyour good-nature. Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank\\nChurchill?--Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do\\nyou do?--Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite\\nin fairy-land!--Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know\\n(eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word,\\nMiss Woodhouse, you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are\\na judge.--She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her\\nhair!--No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I\\ndeclare--and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a\\nmoment.--How do you do? How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. This\\nis delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--Oh! there he is.\\nDon't disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How\\ndo you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through\\nthe town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway\\nand Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr.\\nArthur!--How do you do? How do you all do?--Quite well, I am much\\nobliged to you. Never better.--Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can\\nthis be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming\\nto be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I am\\nquite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A\\nlittle tea if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.\\nEvery thing so good!\"\\n\\nFrank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\\nBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse\\nof Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind\\nher.--He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she could not\\ndetermine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look,\\ncompliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently\\nwanting to be complimented herself--and it was, \"How do you like\\nmy gown?--How do you like my trimming?--How has Wright done my\\nhair?\"--with many other relative questions, all answered with patient\\npoliteness. Mrs. Elton then said, \"Nobody can think less of dress in\\ngeneral than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's\\neyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons--who I have\\nno doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish\\nto be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except\\nmine.--So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall\\nsee if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\\nI like him very well.\"\\n\\nAt this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not\\nbut imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear\\nmore;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till\\nanother suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly\\nforward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\\n\\n\"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--I was\\nthis moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for\\ntidings of us.\"\\n\\n\"Jane!\"--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and\\ndispleasure.--\"That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I\\nsuppose.\"\\n\\n\"How do you like Mrs. Elton?\" said Emma in a whisper.\\n\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\\n\"You are ungrateful.\"\\n\\n\"Ungrateful!--What do you mean?\" Then changing from a frown to a\\nsmile--\"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--Where\\nis my father?--When are we to begin dancing?\"\\n\\nEmma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked\\noff to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and\\nMrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be\\nlaid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton\\nmust be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which\\ninterfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma\\nheard the sad truth with fortitude.\\n\\n\"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?\" said Mr. Weston.\\n\"She will think Frank ought to ask her.\"\\n\\nFrank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and\\nboasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect\\napprobation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_\\nto dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to\\npersuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs.\\nElton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed.\\nEmma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always\\nconsidered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make\\nher think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this\\ntime, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to\\nbegin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston\\nmight be his son's superior.--In spite of this little rub, however,\\nEmma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length\\nof the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours\\nof unusual festivity before her.--She was more disturbed by Mr.\\nKnightley's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was, among\\nthe standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not\\nclassing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who\\nwere pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were\\nmade up,--so young as he looked!--He could not have appeared to greater\\nadvantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall,\\nfirm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of\\nthe elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes;\\nand, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of\\nyoung men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,\\nand those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner,\\nwith what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take the\\ntrouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but\\nin general he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroom\\nbetter, and could like Frank Churchill better.--He seemed often\\nobserving her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of her\\ndancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel\\nafraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.\\nThey seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank\\nChurchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.\\n\\nThe ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant\\nattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed\\nhappy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom\\nbestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in\\nthe very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very\\nrecordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually\\nare. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.--The two\\nlast dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner;--the\\nonly young lady sitting down;--and so equal had been hitherto the\\nnumber of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the\\nwonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton\\nsauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible\\nto be avoided: she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him\\nevery moment to escape into the card-room.\\n\\nEscape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room where\\nthe sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front\\nof them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintaining\\nit. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or\\nspeaking to those who were close to her.--Emma saw it. She was not yet\\ndancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore\\nleisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw\\nit all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly\\nbehind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr.\\nElton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which\\njust then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that\\nhis wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only\\nlistening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The\\nkind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say,\\n\"Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?\" to which his prompt reply was, \"Most\\nreadily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.\"\\n\\n\"Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no\\ndancer.\"\\n\\n\"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,\" said he, \"I shall have great\\npleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old\\nmarried man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very\\ngreat pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.\\nGilbert.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\\ndisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.\" \"Miss\\nSmith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I\\nwere not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston.\\nYou will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your\\ncommand--but my dancing days are over.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and\\nmortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton! the\\namiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--She looked round for a moment; he\\nhad joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself\\nfor settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him\\nand his wife.\\n\\nShe would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her\\nface might be as hot.\\n\\nIn another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley leading\\nHarriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized, seldom more\\ndelighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,\\nboth for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though\\ntoo distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could\\ncatch his eye again.\\n\\nHis dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;\\nand Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for\\nthe cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment\\nand very high sense of the distinction which her happy features\\nannounced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,\\nflew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.\\n\\nMr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very\\nfoolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though\\ngrowing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observing\\naudibly to her partner,\\n\\n\"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very good-natured,\\nI declare.\"\\n\\nSupper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from\\nthat moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and\\ntaking up her spoon.\\n\\n\"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. Mrs.\\nWeston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there will\\nbe draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done--One door\\nnailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane, indeed you must.\\nMr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!--so\\ngratified! Excellent dancing indeed!--Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I\\nsaid I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and\\nnobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.\\nGrandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a\\nvast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits\\nand baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some\\nof her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were\\namused, and who were your partners. 'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestall\\nJane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell\\nyou all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,\\nI do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear\\nsir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am\\nnot helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and\\nme on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is\\ngoing; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we\\nall follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we\\nare at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no,\\nthere is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd!\\nI was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any\\nthing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling\\nyou of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--The\\nbaked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there\\nwas a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at\\nfirst, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled\\nenough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves\\nbetter than sweetbread and asparagus--so she was rather disappointed,\\nbut we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of\\nits getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much\\nconcerned!--Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have\\nsupposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing\\nlike it since--Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere,\\nso that Jane is not in a draught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.\\nOh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--only\\nit seems too good--but just as you please. What you direct in this house\\ncannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes\\nfor grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but\\nit smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.\"\\n\\nEmma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;\\nbut, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited\\nhim irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in his\\nreprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;\\nand Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.\\n\\n\"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,\" said he. \"Emma, why is it\\nthat they are your enemies?\"\\n\\nHe looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,\\n\"_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may\\nbe.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,\\nthat you did want him to marry Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"I did,\" replied Emma, \"and they cannot forgive me.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he\\nonly said,\\n\\n\"I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.\"\\n\\n\"Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell\\nme I am wrong?\"\\n\\n\"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong,\\nI am sure the other tells you of it.\"\\n\\n\"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There is\\na littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not: and I\\nwas fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was through a\\nseries of strange blunders!\"\\n\\n\"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the\\njustice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has\\nchosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which\\nMrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless\\ngirl--infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a\\nwoman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.\"\\n\\nEmma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of\\nMr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.\\n\\n\"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all\\ndoing?--Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!\\nEvery body is asleep!\"\\n\\n\"I am ready,\" said Emma, \"whenever I am wanted.\"\\n\\n\"Whom are you going to dance with?\" asked Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nShe hesitated a moment, and then replied, \"With you, if you will ask\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"Will you?\" said he, offering his hand.\\n\\n\"Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are\\nnot really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.\"\\n\\n\"Brother and sister! no, indeed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nThis little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\\npleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which\\nshe walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely\\nglad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the\\nEltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much\\nalike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was\\npeculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few\\nminutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the\\noccasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward\\nto another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--From\\nHarriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the\\nballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly\\nopened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior\\ncreature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma could\\nharbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious\\ncourtesy. She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for\\nsupplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther\\nrequisite.--Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and\\nMr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer\\nmust be before her!\\n\\nShe was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that he\\ncould not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he was\\nto be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.\\n\\nHaving arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all\\nto rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up\\nfor the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,\\nwhen the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she\\nhad never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill, with Harriet\\nleaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince\\nher that something extraordinary had happened. Harriet looked white\\nand frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--The iron gates and the\\nfront-door were not twenty yards asunder;--they were all three soon in\\nthe hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away.\\n\\nA young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\\nand surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the\\nsuspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted\\nwith the whole.\\n\\nMiss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.\\nGoddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and\\ntaken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough\\nfor safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury,\\nmaking a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became\\nfor a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies\\nhad advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small\\ndistance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a\\nparty of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and\\nMiss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling\\non Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at\\nthe top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.\\nBut poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much from cramp\\nafter dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such\\na return of it as made her absolutely powerless--and in this state, and\\nexceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.\\n\\nHow the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more\\ncourageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could\\nnot be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children,\\nheaded by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and impertinent\\nin look, though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened, she\\nimmediately promised them money, and taking out her purse, gave them a\\nshilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her ill.--She\\nwas then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away--but her\\nterror and her purse were too tempting, and she was followed, or rather\\nsurrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.\\n\\nIn this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and\\nconditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his\\nleaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance\\nat this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced\\nhim to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,\\na mile or two beyond Highbury--and happening to have borrowed a pair\\nof scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to\\nrestore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a\\nfew minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being\\non foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The\\nterror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then\\ntheir own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet\\neagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength\\nenough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome.\\nIt was his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other\\nplace.\\n\\nThis was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of\\nHarriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--He dared\\nnot stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him\\nnot another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her\\nsafety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people\\nin the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the grateful\\nblessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.\\n\\nSuch an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young woman\\nthrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain\\nideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at\\nleast. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician\\nhave seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and\\nheard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been\\nat work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?--How much\\nmore must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and\\nforesight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her\\nmind had already made.\\n\\nIt was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever\\noccurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no\\nrencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the very\\nperson, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing\\nto pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And\\nknowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this\\nperiod, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of his\\nattachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.\\nIt seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting\\nconsequences. It was not possible that the occurrence should not be\\nstrongly recommending each to the other.\\n\\nIn the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him, while\\nHarriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,\\nher naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\\nsensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's\\nown account had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the\\nabominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing was\\nto take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.\\nShe would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough of\\ninterference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.\\nIt was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account proceed.\\n\\nEmma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of\\nwhat had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but\\nshe soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour\\nit was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those\\nwho talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in\\nthe place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last night's\\nball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat,\\nand, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their\\npromising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some comfort\\nto him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his\\nneighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss\\nSmith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had\\nthe pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very\\nindifferent--which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,\\nand Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She had\\nan unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man,\\nfor she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent\\nillnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.\\n\\nThe gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took\\nthemselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have\\nwalked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history\\ndwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her\\nnephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and\\nJohn were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the\\ngipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the\\nslightest particular from the original recital.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nA very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one\\nmorning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down\\nand hesitating, thus began:\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I should\\nlike to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then, you know, it\\nwill be over.\"\\n\\nEmma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a\\nseriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her, quite as much as her\\nwords, for something more than ordinary.\\n\\n\"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,\" she continued, \"to have\\nno reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered\\ncreature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have\\nthe satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is\\nnecessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and\\nI dare say you understand me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Emma, \"I hope I do.\"\\n\\n\"How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...\" cried Harriet,\\nwarmly. \"It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary\\nin him now.--I do not care whether I meet him or not--except that of the\\ntwo I had rather not see him--and indeed I would go any distance round\\nto avoid him--but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire\\nher nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and\\nall that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall\\nnever forget her look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss\\nWoodhouse, I wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,\\nit will not give me another moment's pang: and to convince you that I\\nhave been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I ought to\\nhave destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--I know that\\nvery well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I will destroy it\\nall--and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you\\nmay see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel\\nholds?\" said she, with a conscious look.\\n\\n\"Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?\"\\n\\n\"No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued\\nvery much.\"\\n\\nShe held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_\\n_precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.\\nHarriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within\\nabundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,\\nwhich Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,\\nexcepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said Harriet, \"you _must_ recollect.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed I do not.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what\\npassed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last\\ntimes we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my\\nsore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--I think the\\nvery evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new\\npenknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--But, as you had none\\nabout you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took\\nmine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he\\ncut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he\\ngave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making\\na treasure of it--so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now\\nand then as a great treat.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest Harriet!\" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,\\nand jumping up, \"you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.\\nRemember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this\\nrelic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting the\\nfinger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none\\nabout me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my\\npocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual\\nblush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--go on--what\\nelse?\"\\n\\n\"And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected\\nit, you did it so naturally.\"\\n\\n\"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!\"\\nsaid Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\\nbetween wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, \"Lord\\nbless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a\\npiece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I\\nnever was equal to this.\"\\n\\n\"Here,\" resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, \"here is something\\nstill more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because\\nthis is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister\\nnever did.\"\\n\\nEmma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an\\nold pencil,--the part without any lead.\\n\\n\"This was really his,\" said Harriet.--\"Do not you remember one\\nmorning?--no, I dare say you do not. But one morning--I forget exactly\\nthe day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_\\n_evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was\\nabout spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about\\nbrewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out\\nhis pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and\\nit would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the\\ntable as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I\\ndared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.\"\\n\\n\"I do remember it,\" cried Emma; \"I perfectly remember it.--Talking\\nabout spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we\\nliked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I\\nperfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was\\nnot he? I have an idea he was standing just here.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but I cannot\\nrecollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I\\nam now.\"--\\n\\n\"Well, go on.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--except that\\nI am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see\\nme do it.\"\\n\\n\"My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in\\ntreasuring up these things?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I\\ncould forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you\\nknow, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was--but\\nhad not resolution enough to part with them.\"\\n\\n\"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not\\na word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be\\nuseful.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be happier to burn it,\" replied Harriet. \"It has a disagreeable\\nlook to me. I must get rid of every thing.--There it goes, and there is\\nan end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.\"\\n\\n\"And when,\" thought Emma, \"will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?\"\\n\\nShe had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already\\nmade, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had _told_ no\\nfortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight\\nafter the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite\\nundesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the\\ninformation she received more valuable. She merely said, in the course\\nof some trivial chat, \"Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise\\nyou to do so and so\"--and thought no more of it, till after a minute's\\nsilence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, \"I shall never\\nmarry.\"\\n\\nEmma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a\\nmoment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,\\n\\n\"Never marry!--This is a new resolution.\"\\n\\n\"It is one that I shall never change, however.\"\\n\\nAfter another short hesitation, \"I hope it does not proceed from--I hope\\nit is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Elton indeed!\" cried Harriet indignantly.--\"Oh! no\"--and Emma could\\njust catch the words, \"so superior to Mr. Elton!\"\\n\\nShe then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no\\nfarther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--Perhaps\\nHarriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she were\\ntotally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too\\nmuch; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such\\nan open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly\\nresolved.--She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at\\nonce, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was always\\nbest. She had previously determined how far she would proceed, on any\\napplication of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the\\njudicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--She was decided,\\nand thus spoke--\\n\\n\"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your\\nresolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from\\nan idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your\\nsuperior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--\\nIndeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a\\ndistance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of\\nthe world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so\\nproper, in me especially.\"\\n\\n\"I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you\\nwas enough to warm your heart.\"\\n\\n\"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--The very\\nrecollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--when I saw him\\ncoming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In\\none moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!\"\\n\\n\"It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.--Yes,\\nhonourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--But that\\nit will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not\\nadvise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage\\nfor its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be\\nwisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not\\nlet them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be\\nobservant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I\\ngive you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on\\nthe subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I\\nknow nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were very\\nwrong before; we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt,\\nand there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but\\nyet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been\\nmatches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would not\\nhave you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your\\nraising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I shall\\nalways know how to value.\"\\n\\nHarriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was\\nvery decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend.\\nIts tendency would be to raise and refine her mind--and it must be\\nsaving her from the danger of degradation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nIn this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon\\nHartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The\\nEltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use\\nto be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her\\ngrandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again\\ndelayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely\\nto remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were able\\nto defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her service, and save herself from\\nbeing hurried into a delightful situation against her will.\\n\\nMr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly\\ntaken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike\\nhim more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit\\nof Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable. Every thing\\ndeclared it; his own attentions, his father's hints, his mother-in-law's\\nguarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and\\nindiscretion, told the same story. But while so many were devoting him\\nto Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley\\nbegan to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He\\ncould not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between\\nthem--he thought so at least--symptoms of admiration on his side, which,\\nhaving once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirely\\nvoid of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors\\nof imagination. _She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose.\\nHe was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he\\nhad seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from\\nthe admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he was\\nagain in their company, he could not help remembering what he had seen;\\nnor could he avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and\\nhis fire at twilight,\\n\\n\"Myself creating what I saw,\"\\n\\nbrought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private\\nliking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane.\\n\\nHe had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend\\nhis evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he joined\\nthem; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like\\nthemselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the\\nweather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates\\nand her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on\\nreaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of\\nvisiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in\\nand drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and\\nafter a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened\\nto, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most\\nobliging invitation.\\n\\nAs they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.\\nThe gentlemen spoke of his horse.\\n\\n\"By the bye,\" said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, \"what\\nbecame of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, \"I did not know that he ever had\\nany such plan.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.\"\\n\\n\"Me! impossible!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what\\nwas certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was\\nextremely happy about it. It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as she\\nthought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You\\nmust remember it now?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.\"\\n\\n\"Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must have\\ndreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith, you walk as if\\nyou were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.\"\\n\\n\"What is this?--What is this?\" cried Mr. Weston, \"about Perry and a\\ncarriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he can\\nafford it. You had it from himself, had you?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied his son, laughing, \"I seem to have had it from\\nnobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having\\nmentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all\\nthese particulars--but as she declares she never heard a syllable of\\nit before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer.\\nI dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--and when I have gone\\nthrough my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.\\nPerry.\"\\n\\n\"It is odd though,\" observed his father, \"that you should have had such\\na regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\\nshould be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his carriage! and\\nhis wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health--just\\nwhat will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little\\npremature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!\\nAnd at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream\\ncertainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent.\\nEmma, you are a great dreamer, I think?\"\\n\\nEmma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to\\nprepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr.\\nWeston's hint.\\n\\n\"Why, to own the truth,\" cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\\nto be heard the last two minutes, \"if I must speak on this subject,\\nthere is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not mean\\nto say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes the oddest\\ndreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge\\nthat there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself\\nmentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as\\nourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only\\nthought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should\\nhave a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning\\nbecause she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don't you remember\\ngrandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we\\nhad been walking to--very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to\\nRandalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed\\nI do not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\\nshe had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go\\nbeyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that\\nI know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having\\nnever dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before\\nI am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and\\nthen I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like\\nJane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least\\nthing in the world. Where is she?--Oh! just behind. Perfectly remember\\nMrs. Perry's coming.--Extraordinary dream, indeed!\"\\n\\nThey were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss\\nBates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where\\nhe thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had\\ninvoluntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy\\nwith her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited\\nat the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank\\nChurchill the determination of catching her eye--he seemed watching her\\nintently--in vain, however, if it were so--Jane passed between them\\ninto the hall, and looked at neither.\\n\\nThere was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be\\nborne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the\\nlarge modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and\\nwhich none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her\\nfather to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his\\ndaily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly,\\nand nobody seemed in a hurry to move.\\n\\n\"Miss Woodhouse,\" said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind\\nhim, which he could reach as he sat, \"have your nephews taken away their\\nalphabets--their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is it?\\nThis is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather\\nas winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters one\\nmorning. I want to puzzle you again.\"\\n\\nEmma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table\\nwas quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\\ndisposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words\\nfor each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The quietness\\nof the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had\\noften been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had\\noccasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting,\\nwith tender melancholy, over the departure of the \"poor little boys,\"\\nor in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how\\nbeautifully Emma had written it.\\n\\nFrank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight\\nglance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to\\nEmma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them\\nall; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little\\napparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile\\npushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and\\nburied from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of\\nlooking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after\\nevery fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to\\nwork. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help. The\\nword was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a\\nblush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible.\\nMr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be,\\nwas beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of his\\nfavourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must be some\\ndecided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet\\nhim at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and\\ntrick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank\\nChurchill's part.\\n\\nWith great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm\\nand distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a short\\nword prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure. He\\nsaw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining,\\nthough it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure;\\nfor she said, \"Nonsense! for shame!\" He heard Frank Churchill next say,\\nwith a glance towards Jane, \"I will give it to her--shall I?\"--and as\\nclearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. \"No, no, you\\nmust not; you shall not, indeed.\"\\n\\nIt was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without\\nfeeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed\\nover the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate\\ncivility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity\\nto know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment\\nfor darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it\\nto be _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his;\\nher comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning,\\nthe superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was\\nevidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed\\nmore deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, \"I did not\\nknow that proper names were allowed,\" pushed away the letters with even\\nan angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word\\nthat could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the\\nattack, and turned towards her aunt.\\n\\n\"Aye, very true, my dear,\" cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken\\na word--\"I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be\\ngoing indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking\\nfor us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good\\nnight.\"\\n\\nJane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had\\npreconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but\\nso many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. Knightley\\nthought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards\\nher, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was afterwards\\nlooking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was looking also--it was growing\\ndusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley\\ncould not tell.\\n\\nHe remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of\\nwhat he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his\\nobservations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--an anxious\\nfriend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her\\nin a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was\\nhis duty.\\n\\n\"Pray, Emma,\" said he, \"may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the\\npoignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the\\nword, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the\\none, and so very distressing to the other.\"\\n\\nEmma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true\\nexplanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was\\nreally ashamed of having ever imparted them.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" she cried in evident embarrassment, \"it all meant nothing; a mere\\njoke among ourselves.\"\\n\\n\"The joke,\" he replied gravely, \"seemed confined to you and Mr.\\nChurchill.\"\\n\\nHe had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather\\nbusy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in\\ndoubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference--fruitless\\ninterference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to\\ndeclare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to her,\\nto risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference,\\nrather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the\\nremembrance of neglect in such a cause.\\n\\n\"My dear Emma,\" said he at last, with earnest kindness, \"do you\\nthink you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the\\ngentleman and lady we have been speaking of?\"\\n\\n\"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.--Why\\ndo you make a doubt of it?\"\\n\\n\"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or\\nthat she admired him?\"\\n\\n\"Never, never!\" she cried with a most open eagerness--\"Never, for the\\ntwentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could\\nit possibly come into your head?\"\\n\\n\"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between\\nthem--certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be\\npublic.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can\\nvouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--very sorry\\nto check you in your first essay--but indeed it will not do. There is no\\nadmiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which\\nhave caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances--feelings\\nrather of a totally different nature--it is impossible exactly to\\nexplain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it--but the part which is\\ncapable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far\\nfrom any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in\\nthe world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I\\ncan _answer_ for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman's\\nindifference.\"\\n\\nShe spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction\\nwhich silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have\\nprolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his\\nsuspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a\\ncircumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet\\nhers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too much\\nirritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolute\\nfever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender habits required almost\\nevery evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hasty\\nleave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nAfter being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.\\nSuckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\\nof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such\\nimportation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at\\npresent. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted\\nto the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' coming had\\nbeen united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health\\nseemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs.\\nWeston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much\\nincreased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was\\nby the approach of it.\\n\\nMrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal\\nof pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all\\nwait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought\\nat first;--but a little consideration convinced her that every thing\\nneed not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though\\nthe Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the\\nautumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was\\nto be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the\\nidea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what\\nevery body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed\\nto chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more of the\\nchosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a\\nquiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and\\npreparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the\\nEltons and the Sucklings.\\n\\nThis was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but\\nfeel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston\\nthat he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and sister had\\nfailed her, that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that\\nas Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she\\nhad no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing but her very great\\ndislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly\\naware, it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done\\nwithout a reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and\\nshe found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which\\nshe would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would\\nprobably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs.\\nElton's party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her\\noutward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her\\nreflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.\\n\\n\"I am glad you approve of what I have done,\" said he very comfortably.\\n\"But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without\\nnumbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its\\nown amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not\\nleave her out.\"\\n\\nEmma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.\\n\\nIt was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton\\nwas growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to\\npigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing\\ninto sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,\\nbefore the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured\\non, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources were\\ninadequate to such an attack.\\n\\n\"Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?\" she cried.--\"And such weather\\nfor exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What\\nare we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing\\ndone. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful\\nexploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.\"\\n\\n\"You had better explore to Donwell,\" replied Mr. Knightley. \"That may\\nbe done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripening\\nfast.\"\\n\\nIf Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\\nfor his proposal was caught at with delight; and the \"Oh! I should like\\nit of all things,\" was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was\\nfamous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:\\nbut no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt\\nthe lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again\\nand again to come--much oftener than he doubted--and was extremely\\ngratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment\\nas she chose to consider it.\\n\\n\"You may depend upon me,\" said she. \"I certainly will come. Name your\\nday, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot name a day,\" said he, \"till I have spoken to some others whom\\nI would wish to meet you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am Lady\\nPatroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.\"\\n\\n\"I hope you will bring Elton,\" said he: \"but I will not trouble you to\\ngive any other invitations.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider--you need not be afraid\\nof delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her preferment.\\nMarried women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party. Leave\\nit all to me. I will invite your guests.\"\\n\\n\"No,\"--he calmly replied,--\"there is but one married woman in the world\\nwhom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and\\nthat one is--\"\\n\\n\"--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,\" interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\\n\\n\"No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage such\\nmatters myself.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you are an odd creature!\" she cried, satisfied to have no one\\npreferred to herself.--\"You are a humourist, and may say what you\\nlike. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me--Jane and her\\naunt.--The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting\\nthe Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are attached to them.\"\\n\\n\"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss\\nBates in my way home.\"\\n\\n\"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like. It\\nis to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I\\nshall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging\\non my arm. Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be\\nmore simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be\\nno form or parade--a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about\\nyour gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under\\ntrees;--and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out\\nof doors--a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural\\nand simple as possible. Is not that your idea?\"\\n\\n\"Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have\\nthe table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of\\ngentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is\\nbest observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating\\nstrawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.\"\\n\\n\"Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by the bye,\\ncan I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--Pray be\\nsincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect\\nanything--\"\\n\\n\"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely\\nclever.\"\\n\\n\"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and\\nwould spurn any body's assistance.\"\\n\\n\"I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on\\ndonkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by. I\\nreally must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life\\nI conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever\\nso many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at\\nhome;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust, and in\\nwinter there is dirt.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane is\\nnever dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, if\\nyou prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wish every thing to\\nbe as much to your taste as possible.\"\\n\\n\"That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\\nUnder that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\\nwarmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--Yes,\\nbelieve me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in\\nthe whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please\\nme.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He\\nwished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\\nand he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to\\neat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the\\nspecious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at\\nDonwell, be tempted away to his misery.\\n\\nHe was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for\\nhis easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for two\\nyears. \"Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go\\nvery well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls\\nwalked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp now,\\nin the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house again\\nexceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and\\nany other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to\\nhis, and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning. He\\nthought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kind\\nand sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining\\nout.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence. The\\ninvitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like\\nMrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment\\nto themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of\\npleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to\\njoin them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could\\nhave been dispensed with.--Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that\\nhe should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in\\nwriting, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to\\nBox Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was\\nsettled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing\\nexactly right.\\n\\nUnder a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was\\nsafely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of\\nthis al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the\\nAbbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was\\nhappily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what\\nhad been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not\\nto heat themselves.--Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on\\npurpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when\\nall the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and\\nsympathiser.\\n\\nIt was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she was\\nsatisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him, and look\\naround her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular\\nobservation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must\\never be so interesting to her and all her family.\\n\\nShe felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with\\nthe present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed\\nthe respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,\\ncharacteristic situation, low and sheltered--its ample gardens\\nstretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with\\nall the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight--and its abundance\\nof timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance\\nhad rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike\\nit, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many\\ncomfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought\\nto be, and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect\\nfor it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted\\nin blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had;\\nbut Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given them\\nneither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These were\\npleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it\\nwas necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the\\nstrawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank\\nChurchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,\\nin all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket,\\nwas very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or\\ntalking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or\\nspoken of.--\"The best fruit in England--every body's favourite--always\\nwholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to\\ngather for one's self--the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning\\ndecidedly the best time--never tired--every sort good--hautboy\\ninfinitely superior--no comparison--the others hardly eatable--hautboys\\nvery scarce--Chili preferred--white wood finest flavour of all--price\\nof strawberries in London--abundance about Bristol--Maple\\nGrove--cultivation--beds when to be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly\\ndifferent--no general rule--gardeners never to be put out of their\\nway--delicious fruit--only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior\\nto cherries--currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering\\nstrawberries the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no\\nlonger--must go and sit in the shade.\"\\n\\nSuch, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by\\nMrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to\\ninquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--She had some\\nfears of his horse.\\n\\nSeats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged\\nto overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--A\\nsituation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had\\nreceived notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not\\nwith Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and\\nsplendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs.\\nBragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.\\nDelightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks,\\nevery thing--and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with\\nimmediately.--On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she\\npositively refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax\\ncontinued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any\\nthing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge\\nbefore.--Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an\\nacquiescence by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was\\nastonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and\\nat last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a\\nremoval.--\"Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the\\ngardens--all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent.\"--The\\npertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.\\n\\nIt was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,\\ndispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one\\nanother to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which\\nstretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed\\nthe finish of the pleasure grounds.--It led to nothing; nothing but a\\nview at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed\\nintended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to\\nthe house, which never had been there. Disputable, however, as might be\\nthe taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and\\nthe view which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at\\nnearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper\\nform beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of\\nconsiderable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--and at\\nthe bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the\\nAbbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and\\nhandsome curve around it.\\n\\nIt was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,\\nEnglish culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being\\noppressive.\\n\\nIn this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and\\ntowards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet\\ndistinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and\\nHarriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.--There\\nhad been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and\\nturned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant\\nconversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry\\nto see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now\\nshe feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of\\nprosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in\\nblossom, and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the\\nwall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. He\\nwas giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma\\nreceived a smile which seemed to say, \"These are my own concerns. I have\\na right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of\\nintroducing Robert Martin.\"--She did not suspect him. It was too old\\na story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.--They\\ntook a few turns together along the walk.--The shade was most\\nrefreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.\\n\\nThe next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--and they\\nwere all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs.\\nWeston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himself\\nuneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing\\nthat he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as to\\ncoming, with more than common certainty. \"His aunt was so much better,\\nthat he had not a doubt of getting over to them.\"--Mrs. Churchill's\\nstate, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such\\nsudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable\\ndependence--and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,\\nthat it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was\\nprevented coming.--Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under\\nconsideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\\n\\nThe cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see\\nwhat had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far\\nas the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at\\nany rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.--Mr.\\nWoodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part\\nof the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by him,\\nstirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that\\nMrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and\\nvariety which her spirits seemed to need.\\n\\nMr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's\\nentertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,\\nshells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been\\nprepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness\\nhad perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused.\\nMrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he would shew them\\nall to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than\\nin a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and\\nmethodical.--Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma\\nwalked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation of\\nthe entrance and ground-plot of the house--and was hardly there, when\\nJane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a\\nlook of escape.--Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there\\nwas a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in\\nquest of.\\n\\n\"Will you be so kind,\" said she, \"when I am missed, as to say that I am\\ngone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware how late it\\nis, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we shall be wanted,\\nand I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing about it to any\\nbody. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to the\\nponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not be\\nmissed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am\\ngone?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury\\nalone?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty\\nminutes.\"\\n\\n\"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my\\nfather's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage. It can be\\nround in five minutes.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--And\\nfor _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have to\\nguard others!\"\\n\\nShe spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, \"That\\ncan be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the\\ncarriage. The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already.\"\\n\\n\"I am,\"--she answered--\"I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of\\nfatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all know\\nat times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are\\nexhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me have\\nmy own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.\"\\n\\nEmma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into\\nher feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and\\nwatched her safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was\\ngrateful--and her parting words, \"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of\\nbeing sometimes alone!\"--seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and\\nto describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,\\neven towards some of those who loved her best.\\n\\n\"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!\" said Emma, as she turned back into\\nthe hall again. \"I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of\\ntheir just horrors, the more I shall like you.\"\\n\\nJane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only\\naccomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank\\nChurchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had\\nforgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Weston\\nwould be at ease. The black mare was blameless; _they_ were right\\nwho had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been detained by\\na temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had\\nlasted some hours--and he had quite given up every thought of coming,\\ntill very late;--and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and\\nhow late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have\\ncome at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing\\nlike it--almost wished he had staid at home--nothing killed him\\nlike heat--he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was\\nintolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the\\nslight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire, looking very deplorable.\\n\\n\"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,\" said Emma.\\n\\n\"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be\\nspared--but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be\\ngoing soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met _one_ as I\\ncame--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!\"\\n\\nEmma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's\\nstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of\\nhumour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be\\nhis constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often\\nthe cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking\\nsome refreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the\\ndining-room--and she humanely pointed out the door.\\n\\n\"No--he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him\\nhotter.\" In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and\\nmuttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all her\\nattention to her father, saying in secret--\\n\\n\"I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a man\\nwho is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet's sweet easy temper\\nwill not mind it.\"\\n\\nHe was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came\\nback all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners, like\\nhimself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their\\nemployment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.\\nHe was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and,\\nat last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking\\nover views in Swisserland.\\n\\n\"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,\" said he. \"I shall\\nnever be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my\\nsketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour to read--or my\\npoem. I shall do something to expose myself.\"\\n\\n\"That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to\\nSwisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England.\"\\n\\n\"They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for\\nher. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I\\nassure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I\\nshall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I\\nwant a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating\\neyes may fancy--I am sick of England--and would leave it to-morrow, if\\nI could.\"\\n\\n\"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few\\nhardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?\"\\n\\n\"_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do\\nnot look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted\\nin every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate\\nperson.\"\\n\\n\"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and\\neat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of\\ncold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on\\na par with the rest of us.\"\\n\\n\"No--I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.\"\\n\\n\"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us. It is not\\nSwisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of\\na change. You will stay, and go with us?\"\\n\\n\"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.\"\\n\\n\"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\n\"No--It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.\"\\n\\n\"Then pray stay at Richmond.\"\\n\\n\"But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you\\nall there without me.\"\\n\\n\"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your\\nown degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.\\nWith some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others\\ntook it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and\\ndisturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained. That it was\\ntime for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short final\\narrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted. Frank Churchill's\\nlittle inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his last\\nwords to Emma were,\\n\\n\"Well;--if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.\"\\n\\nShe smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond\\nwas to take him back before the following evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nThey had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\\ncircumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in\\nfavour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating\\nsafely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good\\ntime. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with\\nthe Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.\\nWoodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.\\nSeven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body\\nhad a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount\\nof the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits,\\na want of union, which could not be got over. They separated too much\\ninto parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of\\nMiss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.\\nAnd Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed\\nat first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. Mr. and\\nMrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable\\nas they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the\\nhill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties,\\ntoo strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any\\ncheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.\\n\\nAt first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank\\nChurchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing--looked\\nwithout seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without knowing\\nwhat she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet\\nshould be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\\n\\nWhen they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\\nfor Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.\\nEvery distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.\\nTo amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he cared\\nfor--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay\\nand easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the admission\\nto be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most animating\\nperiod of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own estimation,\\nmeant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it must\\nhave had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very\\nwell describe. \"Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together\\nexcessively.\" They were laying themselves open to that very phrase--and\\nto having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to\\nIreland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any\\nreal felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had\\nexpected. She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked\\nhim for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,\\nadmiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning\\nback her heart. She still intended him for her friend.\\n\\n\"How much I am obliged to you,\" said he, \"for telling me to come\\nto-day!--If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all\\nthe happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you\\nwere too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than you\\ndeserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to come.\"\\n\\n\"Don't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.\"\\n\\n\"It is hotter to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.\"\\n\\n\"You are comfortable because you are under command.\"\\n\\n\"Your command?--Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,\\nsomehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own\\nmanagement; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot be always\\nwith you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command\\nrather than mine.\"\\n\\n\"It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a\\nmotive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always\\nwith me. You are always with me.\"\\n\\n\"Dating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not\\nbegin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.\"\\n\\n\"Three o'clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you\\nfirst in February.\"\\n\\n\"Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)--nobody\\nspeaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking\\nnonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.\"\\n\\n\"I say nothing of which I am ashamed,\" replied he, with lively\\nimpudence. \"I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill\\nhear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side,\\nand Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February.\" And then\\nwhispering--\"Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do\\nto rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk. Ladies\\nand gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,\\npresides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking\\nof?\"\\n\\nSome laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great\\ndeal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; Mr.\\nKnightley's answer was the most distinct.\\n\\n\"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all\\nthinking of?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, no\"--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--\"Upon no\\naccount in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt\\nof just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking\\nof. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing\\nat Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of\\nknowing.\"\\n\\n\"It is a sort of thing,\" cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, \"which _I_\\nshould not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,\\nperhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party--_I_ never was in any\\ncircle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--\"\\n\\nHer mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,\\n\\n\"Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed--quite unheard\\nof--but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every\\nbody knows what is due to _you_.\"\\n\\n\"It will not do,\" whispered Frank to Emma; \"they are most of them\\naffronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen--I\\nam ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of\\nknowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires\\nsomething very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here\\nare seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very\\nentertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one\\nthing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated--or two\\nthings moderately clever--or three things very dull indeed, and she\\nengages to laugh heartily at them all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very well,\" exclaimed Miss Bates, \"then I need not be uneasy.\\n'Three things very dull indeed.' That will just do for me, you know. I\\nshall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,\\nshan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every\\nbody's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?\"\\n\\nEmma could not resist.\\n\\n\"Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me--but you will be\\nlimited as to number--only three at once.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not\\nimmediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not\\nanger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.\\n\\n\"Ah!--well--to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.\\nKnightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very\\ndisagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.\"\\n\\n\"I like your plan,\" cried Mr. Weston. \"Agreed, agreed. I will do my\\nbest. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?\"\\n\\n\"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,\" answered his son;--\"but we shall be\\nindulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" said Emma, \"it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.\\nWeston's shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me\\nhear it.\"\\n\\n\"I doubt its being very clever myself,\" said Mr. Weston. \"It is too much\\na matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters of the alphabet are\\nthere, that express perfection?\"\\n\\n\"What two letters!--express perfection! I am sure I do not know.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never\\nguess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?\"\\n\\nUnderstanding and gratification came together. It might be a very\\nindifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and\\nenjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem to touch\\nthe rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr.\\nKnightley gravely said,\\n\\n\"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\\nhas done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body\\nelse. _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,\" said Mrs. Elton; \"_I_\\nreally cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had\\nan acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all\\npleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!--You know\\nwho I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very\\nwell at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of\\nplace, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer.\\nMiss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have witty\\nthings at every body's service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have a\\ngreat deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed to\\njudge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please,\\nMr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothing\\nclever to say--not one of us.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,\" added her husband, with a sort of sneering\\nconsciousness; \"_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss\\nWoodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man--quite good for\\nnothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?\"\\n\\n\"With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.\\nCome, Jane, take my other arm.\"\\n\\nJane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.\\n\"Happy couple!\" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of\\nhearing:--\"How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as they\\ndid, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew\\neach other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!--for as to\\nany real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, or any public\\nplace, can give--it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is\\nonly by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as\\nthey always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it\\nis all guess and luck--and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man\\nhas committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest\\nof his life!\"\\n\\nMiss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own\\nconfederates, spoke now.\\n\\n\"Such things do occur, undoubtedly.\"--She was stopped by a cough. Frank\\nChurchill turned towards her to listen.\\n\\n\"You were speaking,\" said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.\\n\\n\"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances\\ndo sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be\\nvery frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--but there is\\ngenerally time to recover from it afterwards. I would be understood to\\nmean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness\\nmust be always at the mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunate\\nacquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.\"\\n\\nHe made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon\\nafterwards said, in a lively tone,\\n\\n\"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I\\nmarry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning to\\nEmma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like any body\\nfixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a smile at\\nhis father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt her, educate\\nher.\"\\n\\n\"And make her like myself.\"\\n\\n\"By all means, if you can.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife.\"\\n\\n\"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.\\nI shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return, I shall come\\nto you for my wife. Remember.\"\\n\\nEmma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every\\nfavourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\\nHazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.\\nHe might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could say?\\nReferring the education to her seemed to imply it.\\n\\n\"Now, ma'am,\" said Jane to her aunt, \"shall we join Mrs. Elton?\"\\n\\n\"If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was\\nready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall\\nsoon overtake her. There she is--no, that's somebody else. That's one\\nof the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--Well, I\\ndeclare--\"\\n\\nThey walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr. Weston,\\nhis son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man's spirits\\nnow rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at last of\\nflattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about\\nwith any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended\\nto, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her. The\\nappearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the\\ncarriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and\\npreparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _her_\\ncarriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive\\nhome which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of\\npleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,\\nshe hoped never to be betrayed into again.\\n\\nWhile waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. He\\nlooked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,\\n\\n\"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a\\nprivilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it.\\nI cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be\\nso unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to\\na woman of her character, age, and situation?--Emma, I had not thought\\nit possible.\"\\n\\nEmma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.\\n\\n\"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it.\\nIt was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of\\nit since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--with what\\ncandour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your\\nforbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for\\never receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be\\nso irksome.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Emma, \"I know there is not a better creature in the world:\\nbut you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most\\nunfortunately blended in her.\"\\n\\n\"They are blended,\" said he, \"I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,\\nI could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over\\nthe good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless\\nabsurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any\\nliberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation--but, Emma,\\nconsider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk\\nfrom the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must\\nprobably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was\\nbadly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she had\\nseen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have you\\nnow, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her,\\nhumble her--and before her niece, too--and before others, many of whom\\n(certainly _some_,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment\\nof her.--This is not pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from\\npleasant to me; but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;\\nsatisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and\\ntrusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you\\ncan do now.\"\\n\\nWhile they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was\\nready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had\\nmisinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her\\ntongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,\\nmortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and, on\\nentering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome--then reproaching\\nherself for having taken no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in\\napparent sullenness, she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a\\ndifference; but it was just too late. He had turned away, and the horses\\nwere in motion. She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with\\nwhat appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and\\nevery thing left far behind. She was vexed beyond what could have been\\nexpressed--almost beyond what she could conceal. Never had she felt so\\nagitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life. She was\\nmost forcibly struck. The truth of this representation there was no\\ndenying. She felt it at her heart. How could she have been so brutal,\\nso cruel to Miss Bates! How could she have exposed herself to such ill\\nopinion in any one she valued! And how suffer him to leave her without\\nsaying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!\\n\\nTime did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel\\nit more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary\\nto speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself,\\nfagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running\\ndown her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble to\\ncheck them, extraordinary as they were.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nThe wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all the\\nevening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could\\nnot tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways,\\nmight be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was\\na morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\\nsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than\\nany she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her father,\\nwas felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she\\nwas giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort; and\\nfeeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and\\nconfiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct, be open to any\\nsevere reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart.\\nShe hoped no one could have said to her, \"How could you be so unfeeling\\nto your father?--I must, I will tell you truths while I can.\" Miss\\nBates should never again--no, never! If attention, in future, could do\\naway the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had been often remiss,\\nher conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact;\\nscornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the warmth of true\\ncontrition, she would call upon her the very next morning, and it should\\nbe the beginning, on her side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.\\n\\nShe was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that\\nnothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she\\nmight see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in\\nwhile she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be\\nashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.\\nHer eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.\\n\\n\"The ladies were all at home.\" She had never rejoiced at the sound\\nbefore, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,\\nwith any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of\\nderiving it, except in subsequent ridicule.\\n\\nThere was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.\\nShe heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the\\nmaid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait a\\nmoment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed both\\nescaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse of,\\nlooking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she heard\\nMiss Bates saying, \"Well, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid down upon\\nthe bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.\"\\n\\nPoor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did not\\nquite understand what was going on.\\n\\n\"I am afraid Jane is not very well,\" said she, \"but I do not know; they\\n_tell_ me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently,\\nMiss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I am\\nvery little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where you like? I\\nam sure she will be here presently.\"\\n\\nEmma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment's fear of Miss Bates\\nkeeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came--\"Very happy and\\nobliged\"--but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the same\\ncheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner. A very\\nfriendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a\\nreturn of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.\\n\\n\"Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--and\\nare come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in\\nme--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for us\\nto part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful\\nheadache just now, writing all the morning:--such long letters, you\\nknow, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. 'My dear,' said\\nI, 'you will blind yourself'--for tears were in her eyes perpetually.\\nOne cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great change; and though\\nshe is amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no\\nyoung woman before ever met with on first going out--do not think us\\nungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(again\\ndispersing her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a\\nheadache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel\\nany blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as possible. To\\nlook at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have\\nsecured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming to you--she is\\nnot able--she is gone into her own room--I want her to lie down upon the\\nbed. 'My dear,' said I, 'I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:'\\nbut, however, she is not; she is walking about the room. But, now that\\nshe has written her letters, she says she shall soon be well. She will\\nbe extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your\\nkindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite\\nashamed--but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that\\nwe had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not\\nknow any body was coming. 'It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I, 'depend upon\\nit. Nobody else would come so early.' 'Well,' said she, 'it must be\\nborne some time or other, and it may as well be now.' But then Patty\\ncame in, and said it was you. 'Oh!' said I, 'it is Miss Woodhouse: I am\\nsure you will like to see her.'--'I can see nobody,' said she; and\\nup she got, and would go away; and that was what made us keep you\\nwaiting--and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. 'If you must go, my\\ndear,' said I, 'you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the\\nbed.'\"\\n\\nEmma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing\\nkinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted\\nas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing but\\npity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of\\nthe past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on\\nseeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when she might not bear\\nto see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnest regret and\\nsolicitude--sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected\\nfrom Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much for\\nMiss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible. \"It must be a severe\\ntrial to them all. She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel\\nCampbell's return.\"\\n\\n\"So very kind!\" replied Miss Bates. \"But you are always kind.\"\\n\\nThere was no bearing such an \"always;\" and to break through her dreadful\\ngratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--\\n\\n\"Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?\"\\n\\n\"To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have the charge\\nof her three little girls--delightful children. Impossible that any\\nsituation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,\\nMrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but Mrs. Smallridge is\\nintimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four\\nmiles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She\\nwould not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, 'No;' for when Jane\\nfirst heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning\\nwe were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite decided\\nagainst accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly\\nas you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel\\nCampbell's return, and nothing should induce her to enter into any\\nengagement at present--and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over\\nagain--and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her\\nmind!--but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw\\nfarther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in\\nsuch a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she\\npositively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as\\nJane wished her; she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it\\nwas all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not\\nthe least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that\\nupon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, she\\nhad come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it\\ntill it was all settled.\"\\n\\n\"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon\\nthe hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. 'You _must_\\n_all_ spend your evening with us,' said she--'I positively must have you\\n_all_ come.'\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?\"\\n\\n\"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I\\nthought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him\\noff, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and\\na very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss\\nWoodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed\\nrather fagged after the morning's party. Even pleasure, you know, is\\nfatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have\\nenjoyed it. However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party,\\nand feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been\\nmaking up her mind the whole day?\"\\n\\n\"I dare say she had.\"\\n\\n\"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her\\nfriends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is\\npossible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing\\nin the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and\\nBragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal\\nand elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most\\ndelightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove--and as\\nto the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there\\nare not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with\\nsuch regard and kindness!--It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of\\npleasure.--And her salary!--I really cannot venture to name her salary\\nto you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would\\nhardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! madam,\" cried Emma, \"if other children are at all like what I\\nremember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of\\nwhat I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly\\nearned.\"\\n\\n\"You are so noble in your ideas!\"\\n\\n\"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?\"\\n\\n\"Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. Within a\\nfortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not\\nknow how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and\\nsay, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any more.\"\\n\\n\"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and\\nMrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their\\nreturn?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation\\nas she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so astonished\\nwhen she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and when\\nMrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it! It was\\nbefore tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea, because we were\\njust going to cards--and yet it was before tea, because I remember\\nthinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something happened\\nbefore tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before\\ntea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I\\nhave a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven\\nyears; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the\\nrheumatic gout in his joints--I must go and see him to-day; and so will\\nJane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John's son came to\\ntalk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do\\nhimself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing\\nof that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;\\nand so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been\\ntelling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to\\nRandalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened\\nbefore tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this\\ncircumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she\\ncould be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill's\\ngoing, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\\naccumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the\\nservants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond\\nsoon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger,\\nhowever, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had\\nsent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable\\naccount of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming\\nback beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having\\nresolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse\\nseeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the\\nCrown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy\\ngoing a good pace, and driving very steady.\\n\\nThere was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it\\ncaught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject which already\\nengaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's importance in\\nthe world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was every thing, the\\nother nothing--and she sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny,\\nand quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss\\nBates's saying,\\n\\n\"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become\\nof that?--Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--'You\\nmust go,' said she. 'You and I must part. You will have no business\\nhere.--Let it stay, however,' said she; 'give it houseroom till Colonel\\nCampbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for\\nme; he will help me out of all my difficulties.'--And to this day, I do\\nbelieve, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter's.\"\\n\\nNow Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of\\nall her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,\\nthat she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough;\\nand, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of\\nthe good wishes which she really felt, took leave.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nEmma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;\\nbut on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr.\\nKnightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting\\nwith her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner\\ndecidedly graver than usual, said,\\n\\n\"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\\nand therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend\\na few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say,\\nbesides the 'love,' which nobody carries?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time.\"\\n\\nEmma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,\\nhowever, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends\\nagain. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--her father\\nbegan his inquiries.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you find my\\nworthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must have been very\\nmuch obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs.\\nand Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so\\nattentive to them!\"\\n\\nEmma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a\\nsmile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.\\nKnightley.--It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in\\nher favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that\\nhad passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--\\nHe looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified--and in\\nanother moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common\\nfriendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--whether she had not\\nherself made the first motion, she could not say--she might, perhaps,\\nhave rather offered it--but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly\\nwas on the point of carrying it to his lips--when, from some fancy or\\nother, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel such a scruple, why\\nhe should change his mind when it was all but done, she could not\\nperceive.--He would have judged better, she thought, if he had not\\nstopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was\\nthat his manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it\\nhappened, but she thought nothing became him more.--It was with him,\\nof so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--She could not but recall the\\nattempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.--He left\\nthem immediately afterwards--gone in a moment. He always moved with the\\nalertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but\\nnow he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.\\n\\nEmma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she\\nhad left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure\\nto talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--Neither\\nwould she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she\\nknew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have happened\\nat a better time--and to have had longer notice of it, would have been\\npleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however; she could not\\nbe deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished\\ngallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered\\nhis good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half an hour, she\\nfound. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!\\n\\nIn the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeableness\\nof Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on\\nhorseback, which she knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her\\nnews of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the effect was justified;\\nit supplied a very useful check,--interested, without disturbing him. He\\nhad long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and\\ncould talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had\\nbeen an unexpected blow.\\n\\n\"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably\\nsettled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say\\nher acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry\\nsituation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to\\nbe a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me.\\nYou know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor\\nwas to us. And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be\\ninduced to go away after it has been her home so long.\"\\n\\nThe following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else\\ninto the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the\\ndeath of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason\\nto hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty\\nhours after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any\\nthing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short\\nstruggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\\n\\nIt was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of\\ngravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the\\nsurviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where\\nshe would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops\\nto folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be\\ndisagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.\\nMrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was\\nnow spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully\\njustified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The\\nevent acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of\\nimaginary complaints.\\n\\n\"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\\nmore than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try the\\ntemper. It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults, what\\nwould Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill's loss would be\\ndreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.\"--Even Mr.\\nWeston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, \"Ah! poor woman,\\nwho would have thought it!\" and resolved, that his mourning should be as\\nhandsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her\\nbroad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. How it\\nwould affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It was also\\na very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs. Churchill,\\nthe grief of her husband--her mind glanced over them both with awe and\\ncompassion--and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might\\nbe affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw in a moment\\nall the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have\\nnothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared\\nby nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his\\nnephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form\\nthe attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel\\nno certainty of its being already formed.\\n\\nHarriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.\\nWhat ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. Emma\\nwas gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,\\nand refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.\\nThey spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual\\nforbearance.\\n\\nShort letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all\\nthat was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill\\nwas better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the\\ndeparture of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very\\nold friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a\\nvisit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for\\nHarriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible\\non Emma's side.\\n\\nIt was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose\\nprospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose engagements\\nnow allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her\\nkindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely\\na stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she\\nhad been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she\\nwould have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted\\nto be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and testify\\nrespect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day\\nat Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation was refused,\\nand by a verbal message. \"Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;\"\\nand when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it appeared\\nthat she was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against\\nher own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering under severe\\nheadaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him doubt the\\npossibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time proposed.\\nHer health seemed for the moment completely deranged--appetite quite\\ngone--and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing\\ntouching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehension\\nof the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought she had\\nundertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so herself,\\nthough she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her\\npresent home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous\\ndisorder:--confined always to one room;--he could have wished it\\notherwise--and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must\\nacknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that\\ndescription. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,\\nin fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived\\nmore evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;\\ngrieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some\\nway of being useful. To take her--be it only an hour or two--from\\nher aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational\\nconversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the\\nfollowing morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language\\nshe could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any\\nhour that Jane would name--mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided\\nopinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was only\\nin this short note:\\n\\n\"Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any\\nexercise.\"\\n\\nEmma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was\\nimpossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed\\nindisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best\\ncounteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the\\nanswer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's,\\nin the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--but it would not\\ndo;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing\\nwith her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest\\nservice--and every thing that message could do was tried--but all in\\nvain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was\\nquite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her\\nworse.--Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;\\nbut, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear\\nthat she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.\\n\"Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any\\nbody--any body at all--Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and\\nMrs. Cole had made such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but,\\nexcept them, Jane would really see nobody.\"\\n\\nEmma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\\nand the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could\\nshe feel any right of preference herself--she submitted, therefore, and\\nonly questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece's appetite and diet,\\nwhich she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates\\nwas very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any\\nthing:--Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing\\nthey could command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was\\ndistasteful.\\n\\nEmma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an\\nexamination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality\\nwas speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In half\\nan hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from Miss\\nBates, but \"dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent\\nback; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover, she insisted on\\nher saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.\"\\n\\nWhen Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering\\nabout the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of\\nthe very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to any\\nexercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,\\nshe could have no doubt--putting every thing together--that Jane was\\nresolved to receive no kindness from _her_. She was sorry, very sorry.\\nHer heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable\\nfrom this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and\\ninequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little\\ncredit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but\\nshe had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and of\\nbeing able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy\\nto all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen\\ninto her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to\\nreprove.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nOne morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma was\\ncalled downstairs to Mr. Weston, who \"could not stay five minutes,\\nand wanted particularly to speak with her.\"--He met her at the\\nparlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of\\nhis voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,\\n\\n\"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it be\\npossible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.\"\\n\\n\"Is she unwell?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, not at all--only a little agitated. She would have ordered the\\ncarriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you\\nknow--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what\\nyou ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?--Is she really not\\nill?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon me--but ask no more questions. You will know it all in\\ntime. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!\"\\n\\nTo guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something\\nreally important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was\\nwell, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her father,\\nthat she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon out of\\nthe house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.\\n\\n\"Now,\"--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--\"now\\nMr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\"--he gravely replied.--\"Don't ask me. I promised my wife to\\nleave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not\\nbe impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.\"\\n\\n\"Break it to me,\" cried Emma, standing still with terror.--\"Good\\nGod!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened in Brunswick\\nSquare. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what it\\nis.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed you are mistaken.\"--\\n\\n\"Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest\\nfriends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?--I charge you\\nby all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Emma.\"--\\n\\n\"Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour, that\\nit has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!--What can be to be\\n_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my honour,\" said he very seriously, \"it does not. It is not in\\nthe smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of\\nKnightley.\"\\n\\nEmma's courage returned, and she walked on.\\n\\n\"I was wrong,\" he continued, \"in talking of its being _broke_ to you.\\nI should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern\\nyou--it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short, my\\ndear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don't\\nsay that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might be much\\nworse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.\"\\n\\nEmma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She\\nasked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and\\nthat soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money\\nconcern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the\\ncircumstances of the family,--something which the late event at Richmond\\nhad brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural\\nchildren, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--This, though very\\nundesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little more\\nthan an animating curiosity.\\n\\n\"Who is that gentleman on horseback?\" said she, as they\\nproceeded--speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret,\\nthan with any other view.\\n\\n\"I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank, I\\nassure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"Has your son been with you, then?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.\"\\n\\nFor a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded\\nand demure,\\n\\n\"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.\"\\n\\nThey hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--\"Well, my dear,\" said\\nhe, as they entered the room--\"I have brought her, and now I hope you\\nwill soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in\\ndelay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.\"--And Emma distinctly\\nheard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,--\"I have\\nbeen as good as my word. She has not the least idea.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\\nthat Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she\\neagerly said,\\n\\n\"What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I\\nfind, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is. I have been\\nwalking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense.\\nDo not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your\\ndistress, whatever it may be.\"\\n\\n\"Have you indeed no idea?\" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\\n\"Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you are to\\nhear?\"\\n\\n\"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.\"\\n\\n\"You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;\"\\n(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) \"He has\\nbeen here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is\\nimpossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a\\nsubject,--to announce an attachment--\"\\n\\nShe stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of\\nHarriet.\\n\\n\"More than an attachment, indeed,\" resumed Mrs. Weston; \"an\\nengagement--a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will\\nany body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are\\nengaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!\"\\n\\nEmma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\\n\\n\"Jane Fairfax!--Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?\"\\n\\n\"You may well be amazed,\" returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,\\nand talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--\\n\"You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a solemn\\nengagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth, and\\nkept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but\\nthemselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--It is so\\nwonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost\\nincredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.--I thought I knew him.\"\\n\\nEmma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between two\\nideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and\\npoor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim, and require\\nconfirmation, repeated confirmation.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said she at last, trying to recover herself; \"this is a\\ncircumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at\\nall comprehend it. What!--engaged to her all the winter--before either\\nof them came to Highbury?\"\\n\\n\"Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me, Emma, very\\nmuch. It has hurt his father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we\\ncannot excuse.\"\\n\\nEmma pondered a moment, and then replied, \"I will not pretend _not_ to\\nunderstand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured\\nthat no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are\\napprehensive of.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as\\nsteady as her words.\\n\\n\"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\\npresent perfect indifference,\" she continued, \"I will farther tell you,\\nthat there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I\\ndid like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him--nay,\\nwas attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.\\nFortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,\\nfor at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may\\nbelieve me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find\\nutterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good\\nthan any thing else in the world could do.\\n\\n\"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,\" said she. \"On\\nthis point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you\\nmight be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--\\nImagine what we have been feeling on your account.\"\\n\\n\"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful\\nwonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;\\nand I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he\\nto come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners\\nso _very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as\\nhe certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with persevering\\nattention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged to\\nanother?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--How could\\nhe tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--very wrong,\\nvery wrong indeed.\"\\n\\n\"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--\"\\n\\n\"And how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness!\\nto look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\\nbefore her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,\\nwhich I can neither comprehend nor respect.\"\\n\\n\"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.\\nHe had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a\\nquarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow\\nthe full use even of the time he could stay--but that there had been\\nmisunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed,\\nseemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very\\npossibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.\"\\n\\n\"Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure. Much, much\\nbeyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him\\nin my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!--None of that upright\\nintegrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of\\ntrick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of\\nhis life.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong\\nin this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having\\nmany, very many, good qualities; and--\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" cried Emma, not attending to her.--\"Mrs. Smallridge, too!\\nJane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by\\nsuch horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself--to suffer her\\neven to think of such a measure!\"\\n\\n\"He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit\\nhim. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him--or at\\nleast not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--Till yesterday, I\\nknow he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I do\\nnot know how, but by some letter or message--and it was the discovery of\\nwhat she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him\\nto come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on\\nhis kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of\\nconcealment that had been carrying on so long.\"\\n\\nEmma began to listen better.\\n\\n\"I am to hear from him soon,\" continued Mrs. Weston. \"He told me at\\nparting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\\nseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let\\nus wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It\\nmay make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to\\nbe understood. Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry to\\ncondemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am\\nsatisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious\\nfor its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must\\nboth have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and\\nconcealment.\"\\n\\n\"_His_ sufferings,\" replied Emma dryly, \"do not appear to have done him\\nmuch harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?\"\\n\\n\"Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely a\\ndifficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family!\\nWhile poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a\\nhope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains at rest in\\nthe family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite\\nto what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when undue\\ninfluence does not survive the grave!--He gave his consent with very\\nlittle persuasion.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" thought Emma, \"he would have done as much for Harriet.\"\\n\\n\"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this\\nmorning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time--and\\nthen came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle,\\nto whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,\\nhe could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--He was very much\\nagitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him appear quite\\na different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.--In\\naddition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so\\nvery unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--and there was\\nevery appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.\"\\n\\n\"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such\\nperfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of\\nthe engagement?\"\\n\\nEmma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\\n\\n\"None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in\\nthe world but their two selves.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Emma, \"I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the\\nidea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a\\nvery abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of\\nhypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--To come among us with\\nprofessions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret\\nto judge us all!--Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,\\ncompletely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth\\nand honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been\\ncarrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and\\nwords that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take the\\nconsequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not\\nperfectly agreeable!\"\\n\\n\"I am quite easy on that head,\" replied Mrs. Weston. \"I am very sure\\nthat I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not\\nhave heard.\"\\n\\n\"You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you\\nimagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.\"\\n\\n\"True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\\nFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and\\nas to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.\"\\n\\nAt this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,\\nevidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited him\\nin; and, while he was coming round, added, \"Now, dearest Emma, let me\\nintreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease,\\nand incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of\\nit--and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour. It\\nis not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that,\\nwhy should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for\\nFrank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of such\\nsteadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her\\ncredit for--and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of\\nthis one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may\\nbe said in her situation for even that error!\"\\n\\n\"Much, indeed!\" cried Emma feelingly. \"If a woman can ever be\\nexcused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane\\nFairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that 'the world is not their's,\\nnor the world's law.'\"\\n\\nShe met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\\nexclaiming,\\n\\n\"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a\\ndevice, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of\\nguessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half\\nyour property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of\\ncondolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate\\nyou, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the\\nmost lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter.\"\\n\\nA glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as\\nright as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits was\\nimmediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he shook\\nher heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in\\na manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think\\nthe engagement no very bad thing. His companions suggested only what\\ncould palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they\\nhad talked it all over together, and he had talked it all over again\\nwith Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly\\nreconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank\\ncould possibly have done.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\n\"Harriet, poor Harriet!\"--Those were the words; in them lay the\\ntormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\\nthe real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved very\\nill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _his_\\nbehaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was the\\nscrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account, that gave the\\ndeepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second time the\\ndupe of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken\\nprophetically, when he once said, \"Emma, you have been no friend\\nto Harriet Smith.\"--She was afraid she had done her nothing but\\ndisservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\\ninstance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of\\nthe mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise\\nnever have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged\\nher admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever\\ngiven her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty\\nof having encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have\\nprevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence\\nwould have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought\\nto have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend's\\nhappiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have directed\\nher to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think of him,\\nand that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring\\nfor her.--\"But, with common sense,\" she added, \"I am afraid I have had\\nlittle to do.\"\\n\\nShe was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry\\nwith Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--As for Jane\\nFairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present\\nsolicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need\\nno longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health\\nhaving, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.--Her\\ndays of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well, and\\nhappy, and prosperous.--Emma could now imagine why her own attentions\\nhad been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No\\ndoubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival;\\nand well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be\\nrepulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\\nand arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She\\nunderstood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from\\nthe injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that\\nJane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her\\ndesert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was little\\nsympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful\\nthat this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.\\nConsidering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and\\njudging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing\\nreserve and self-command, it would.--She must communicate the painful\\ntruth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had\\nbeen among Mr. Weston's parting words. \"For the present, the whole\\naffair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of\\nit, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;\\nand every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.\"--Emma had\\npromised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.\\n\\nIn spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost\\nridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate\\noffice to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by\\nherself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,\\nshe was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat quick\\non hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs.\\nWeston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls. Could the event of\\nthe disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--But of that, unfortunately,\\nthere could be no chance.\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Woodhouse!\" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--\"is\\nnot this the oddest news that ever was?\"\\n\\n\"What news do you mean?\" replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or\\nvoice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\\n\\n\"About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!--you\\nneed not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me\\nhimself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret;\\nand, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you,\\nbut he said you knew it.\"\\n\\n\"What did Mr. Weston tell you?\"--said Emma, still perplexed.\\n\\n\"Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill\\nare to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one\\nanother this long while. How very odd!\"\\n\\nIt was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd,\\nthat Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared\\nabsolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or\\ndisappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at\\nher, quite unable to speak.\\n\\n\"Had you any idea,\" cried Harriet, \"of his being in love with her?--You,\\nperhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every\\nbody's heart; but nobody else--\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Emma, \"I begin to doubt my having any such talent.\\nCan you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached\\nto another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not\\nopenly--encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never\\nhad the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\\nChurchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very\\nsure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. \"Why should you caution\\nme?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.\"\\n\\n\"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,\" replied\\nEmma, smiling; \"but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and\\nnot very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you\\ndid care about him?\"\\n\\n\"Him!--never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?\"\\nturning away distressed.\\n\\n\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, after a moment's pause--\"What do you mean?--Good\\nHeaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--\"\\n\\nShe could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she sat down,\\nwaiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\\n\\nHarriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from\\nher, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was\\nin a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.\\n\\n\"I should not have thought it possible,\" she began, \"that you could have\\nmisunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him--but considering\\nhow infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should not have\\nthought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person.\\nMr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him in\\nthe company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than to think of\\nMr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And that you should\\nhave been so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that\\nyou entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I\\nshould have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,\\nto dare to think of him. At first, if you had not told me that more\\nwonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater\\ndisparity (those were your very words);--I should not have dared to\\ngive way to--I should not have thought it possible--But if _you_, who\\nhad been always acquainted with him--\"\\n\\n\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--\"Let us understand\\neach other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you\\nspeaking of--Mr. Knightley?\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else--and so\\nI thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as\\npossible.\"\\n\\n\"Not quite,\" returned Emma, with forced calmness, \"for all that you then\\nsaid, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could almost\\nassert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the service\\nMr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the\\ngipsies, was spoken of.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on\\nthe occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment;\\nthat considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely\\nnatural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to\\nyour sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had\\nbeen in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is\\nstrong on my memory.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear,\" cried Harriet, \"now I recollect what you mean; but I\\nwas thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the\\ngipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some\\nelevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--of Mr.\\nKnightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not\\nstand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That\\nwas the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that\\nwas the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every\\nother being upon earth.\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" cried Emma, \"this has been a most unfortunate--most\\ndeplorable mistake!--What is to be done?\"\\n\\n\"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At\\nleast, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the\\nother had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--\"\\n\\nShe paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.\\n\\n\"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,\" she resumed, \"that you should feel a\\ngreat difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must\\nthink one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But\\nI hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--strange as it may\\nappear--. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful\\nthings had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than\\nbetween Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such\\na thing even as this, may have occurred before--and if I should be so\\nfortunate, beyond expression, as to--if Mr. Knightley should really--if\\n_he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will\\nnot set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. But\\nyou are too good for that, I am sure.\"\\n\\nHarriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look at\\nher in consternation, and hastily said,\\n\\n\"Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--\"I must say that I\\nhave.\"\\n\\nEmma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\\nin a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient\\nfor making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers,\\nonce opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched--she\\nadmitted--she acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse\\nthat Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank\\nChurchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's having\\nsome hope of a return? It darted through her, with the speed of an\\narrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!\\n\\nHer own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same\\nfew minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed\\nher before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How\\ninconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been\\nher conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck her\\nwith dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in the\\nworld. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all\\nthese demerits--some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense\\nof justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the\\ngirl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required\\nthat she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the\\nresolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent\\nkindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost\\nextent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done\\nnothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily\\nformed and maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose\\ncounsels had never led her right.--Rousing from reflection, therefore,\\nand subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more\\ninviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which\\nhad first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was\\nquite sunk and lost.--Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and\\nthemselves.\\n\\nHarriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\\nto be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and\\nsuch a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give\\nthe history of her hopes with great, though trembling delight.--Emma's\\ntremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed than\\nHarriet's, but they were not less. Her voice was not unsteady; but her\\nmind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such\\na burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing\\nemotions, must create.--She listened with much inward suffering, but\\nwith great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well\\narranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but it\\ncontained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of\\nthe narration, a substance to sink her spirit--especially with the\\ncorroborating circumstances, which her own memory brought in favour of\\nMr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.\\n\\nHarriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\\nthose two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\\nfound her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at\\nleast from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her to think of him,\\nHarriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he\\nhad been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different manner\\ntowards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been\\nmore and more aware of it. When they had been all walking together,\\nhe had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very\\ndelightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it\\nto have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to\\nalmost the same extent.--Harriet repeated expressions of approbation\\nand praise from him--and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement\\nwith what she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for\\nbeing without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,\\nfeelings.--She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he\\nhad dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's\\nmemory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from\\nhim, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment\\nimplied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,\\nby Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,\\nand contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed\\nundiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to\\nbe mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without\\nsome degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first, was his walking\\nwith her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they\\nhad been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (as\\nshe was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself--and at first,\\nhe had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done\\nbefore, in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall\\nit without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking her, whether her\\naffections were engaged.--But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared\\nlikely to join them, he changed the subject, and began talking about\\nfarming:--The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half\\nan hour before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of\\nhis being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said that\\nhe could not stay five minutes--and his having told her, during their\\nconversation, that though he must go to London, it was very much against\\nhis inclination that he left home at all, which was much more (as\\nEmma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The superior degree of\\nconfidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her\\nsevere pain.\\n\\nOn the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a\\nlittle reflection, venture the following question. \"Might he not?--Is\\nnot it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of\\nyour affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--he might have\\nMr. Martin's interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with\\nspirit.\\n\\n\"Mr. Martin! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I\\nknow better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.\"\\n\\nWhen Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss\\nWoodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\\n\\n\"I never should have presumed to think of it at first,\" said she, \"but\\nfor you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour\\nbe the rule of mine--and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may\\ndeserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so\\nvery wonderful.\"\\n\\nThe bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings,\\nmade the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable her to say\\non reply,\\n\\n\"Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last\\nman in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his\\nfeeling for her more than he really does.\"\\n\\nHarriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so\\nsatisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which\\nat that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\\nfather's footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too\\nmuch agitated to encounter him. \"She could not compose herself--\\nMr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;\"--with most ready\\nencouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through another\\ndoor--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of\\nEmma's feelings: \"Oh God! that I had never seen her!\"\\n\\nThe rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her\\nthoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had\\nrushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a\\nfresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to\\nher.--How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had\\nbeen thus practising on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the\\nblindness of her own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about,\\nshe tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every\\nposture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had\\nbeen imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had\\nbeen imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she\\nwas wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of\\nwretchedness.\\n\\nTo understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first\\nendeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father's\\nclaims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.\\n\\nHow long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\\ndeclared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?--\\nWhen had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\\nChurchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;\\nshe compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in her\\nestimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her--and as\\nthey must at any time have been compared by her, had it--oh! had it, by\\nany blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.--She\\nsaw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr.\\nKnightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had not\\nbeen infinitely the most dear. She saw, that in persuading herself,\\nin fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a\\ndelusion, totally ignorant of her own heart--and, in short, that she had\\nnever really cared for Frank Churchill at all!\\n\\nThis was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was\\nthe knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which\\nshe reached; and without being long in reaching it.--She was most\\nsorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed\\nto her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--Every other part of her mind\\nwas disgusting.\\n\\nWith insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every\\nbody's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every\\nbody's destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken; and\\nshe had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief. She had\\nbrought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.\\nKnightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on\\nher must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his\\nattachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of\\nHarriet's;--and even were this not the case, he would never have known\\nHarriet at all but for her folly.\\n\\nMr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every\\nwonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax\\nbecame commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no\\nsurprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or\\nthought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on her\\nside! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how it\\nmust sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers,\\nthe merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification and\\ndisdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.--Could\\nit be?--No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very far, from\\nimpossible.--Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities\\nto be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one, perhaps\\ntoo busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was\\nit new for any thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent,\\nincongruous--or for chance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct\\nthe human fate?\\n\\nOh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she\\nought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not, with a\\nfolly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the\\nunexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable\\nin the line of life to which she ought to belong--all would have been\\nsafe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.\\n\\nHow Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to\\nMr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such\\na man till actually assured of it!--But Harriet was less humble, had\\nfewer scruples than formerly.--Her inferiority, whether of mind or\\nsituation, seemed little felt.--She had seemed more sensible of Mr.\\nElton's being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.\\nKnightley's.--Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at\\npains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but\\nherself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,\\nand that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--If\\nHarriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nTill now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\\nhow much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\\nfirst in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so, and feeling\\nit her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the\\ndread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had\\nbeen.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no\\nfemale connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims\\ncould be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far\\nhe loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for\\nmany years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent\\nor perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,\\ninsensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would\\nnot acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,\\nfrom family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he\\nhad loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour to\\nimprove her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other creature\\nhad at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew she was dear\\nto him; might she not say, very dear?--When the suggestions of hope,\\nhowever, which must follow here, presented themselves, she could not\\npresume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy\\nof being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.\\n_She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any idea of\\nblindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very recent\\nproof of its impartiality.--How shocked had he been by her behaviour to\\nMiss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed himself to her\\non the subject!--Not too strongly for the offence--but far, far too\\nstrongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and\\nclear-sighted goodwill.--She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name\\nof hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was\\nnow in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at\\ntimes much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be\\noverrating his regard for _her_.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the\\nconsequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.\\nCould she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all, she\\nbelieved she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the\\nsame Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley to\\nall the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious\\nintercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace would be\\nfully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It would be\\nincompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she felt\\nfor him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She would not\\nmarry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nIt must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she\\nhoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least\\nbe able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them\\nhenceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had\\nhitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know how\\nto admit that she could be blinded here.--He was expected back every\\nday. The power of observation would be soon given--frightfully soon it\\nappeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she\\nresolved against seeing Harriet.--It would do neither of them good,\\nit would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.--She was\\nresolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had\\nno authority for opposing Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only to\\nirritate.--She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg\\nthat she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to\\nbe her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_\\ntopic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed\\nto pass before they met again, except in the company of others--she\\nobjected only to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they\\nhad forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and\\napproved, and was grateful.\\n\\nThis point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's\\nthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,\\nsleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had\\nbeen calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her\\nway home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to\\nrelate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.\\n\\nMr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his\\nshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then\\ninduced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with\\nmuch more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter\\nof an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of\\nawkward feelings, could have afforded.\\n\\nA little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her\\nfriend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal\\nof agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all\\nat present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and\\nto defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr.\\nChurchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as,\\nconsidering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid\\nwithout leading to reports:--but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he\\nwas extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her\\nfamily, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;\\nor if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for \"such things,\"\\nhe observed, \"always got about.\" Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston\\nhad very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short--and very\\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had\\nhardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn\\nhow deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt\\nsatisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her\\ndaughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a\\ngratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly\\nrespectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;\\nthought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of\\nthemselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss\\nFairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to\\ninvite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,\\non being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive,\\nMrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her\\nembarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.\\nApologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception,\\nand the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling\\ntowards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but\\nwhen these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the\\npresent and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was\\nconvinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her\\ncompanion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been,\\nand was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject.\\n\\n\"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so\\nmany months,\" continued Mrs. Weston, \"she was energetic. This was one\\nof her expressions. 'I will not say, that since I entered into the\\nengagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have\\nnever known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--and the quivering lip,\\nEmma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart.\"\\n\\n\"Poor girl!\" said Emma. \"She thinks herself wrong, then, for having\\nconsented to a private engagement?\"\\n\\n\"Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed\\nto blame herself. 'The consequence,' said she, 'has been a state of\\nperpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment\\nthat misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no\\nexpiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all\\nmy sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken,\\nand the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me\\nought not to be.' 'Do not imagine, madam,' she continued, 'that I was\\ntaught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the\\ncare of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own;\\nand I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances\\nmay appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel\\nCampbell.'\"\\n\\n\"Poor girl!\" said Emma again. \"She loves him then excessively, I\\nsuppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be\\nled to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her\\njudgment.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" returned Emma, sighing, \"that I must often have\\ncontributed to make her unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she\\nprobably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the\\nmisunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural\\nconsequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\" she said, \"was\\nthat of making her _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done\\namiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious\\nand irritable to a degree that must have been--that had been--hard for\\nhim to bear. 'I did not make the allowances,' said she, 'which I ought\\nto have done, for his temper and spirits--his delightful spirits, and\\nthat gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other\\ncircumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to\\nme, as they were at first.' She then began to speak of you, and of the\\ngreat kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush\\nwhich shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had\\nan opportunity, to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every\\nwish and every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you had\\nnever received any proper acknowledgment from herself.\"\\n\\n\"If I did not know her to be happy now,\" said Emma, seriously, \"which,\\nin spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she\\nmust be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there\\nwere an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss\\nFairfax!--Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this\\nis all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting\\nparticulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is\\nvery good--I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune\\nshould be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.\"\\n\\nSuch a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought\\nwell of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him\\nvery much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with a\\ngreat deal of reason, and at least equal affection--but she had too much\\nto urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or\\nto Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended\\nwith, \"We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know,\\nbut I hope it will soon come,\" she was obliged to pause before she\\nanswered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could at\\nall recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.\\n\\n\"Are you well, my Emma?\" was Mrs. Weston's parting question.\\n\\n\"Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me\\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible.\"\\n\\nMrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for\\nunpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her\\nsense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted\\nnot having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the\\nenvious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.\\nHad she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention\\nto Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her\\nbetter; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured\\nto find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all\\nprobability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her\\nnow.--Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as\\nan associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other--what\\nwas she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;\\nthat she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this\\nimportant matter--which was most probable--still, in knowing her as\\nshe ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the\\nabominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she\\nhad not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\\nunpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a\\nsubject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the\\nlevity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Of all the sources of evil\\nsurrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded\\nthat she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a\\nperpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without\\nher having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a thousand instances; and on\\nBox Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no\\nmore.\\n\\nThe evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\\nThe weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and\\nnothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was\\ndespoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights\\nthe longer visible.\\n\\nThe weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\\ncomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side, and by\\nexertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded\\nher of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston's\\nwedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea,\\nand dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of\\nHartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly\\nbe over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the\\napproaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,\\nno pleasures had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared\\nwould experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,\\nwas threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--that\\nmight not be even partially brightened. If all took place that\\nmight take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be\\ncomparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\\nspirits only of ruined happiness.\\n\\nThe child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than\\nherself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it.\\nThey should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband\\nalso.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss\\nFairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to\\nHighbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe.\\nAll that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the\\nloss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or\\nof rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be no longer\\ncoming there for his evening comfort!--No longer walking in at all\\nhours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their's!--How was\\nit to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet's sake;\\nif he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society\\nall that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first,\\nthe dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the best\\nblessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but\\nthe reflection never far distant from her mind, that it had been all her\\nown work?\\n\\nWhen it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from\\na start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a\\nfew seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation\\nor composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better\\nconduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might\\nbe the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it\\nwould yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and\\nleave her less to regret when it were gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nThe weather continued much the same all the following morning; and\\nthe same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at\\nHartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a\\nsofter quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was\\nsummer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives, Emma\\nresolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the exquisite\\nsight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after\\na storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for the serenity they\\nmight gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after\\ndinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time\\nin hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened, and\\nthoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she saw Mr.\\nKnightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her.--It\\nwas the first intimation of his being returned from London. She had\\nbeen thinking of him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles\\ndistant.--There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind. She\\nmust be collected and calm. In half a minute they were together. The\\n\"How d'ye do's\" were quiet and constrained on each side. She asked after\\ntheir mutual friends; they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only\\nthat morning. He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with\\nher, she found. \"He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he was\\nnot wanted there, preferred being out of doors.\"--She thought he neither\\nlooked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it,\\nsuggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his\\nplans to his brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had\\nbeen received.\\n\\nThey walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking\\nat her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to\\ngive. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to\\nspeak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for\\nencouragement to begin.--She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the\\nway to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could\\nnot bear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. She\\nconsidered--resolved--and, trying to smile, began--\\n\\n\"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\\nsurprize you.\"\\n\\n\"Have I?\" said he quietly, and looking at her; \"of what nature?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.\"\\n\\nAfter waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he\\nreplied,\\n\\n\"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that\\nalready.\"\\n\\n\"How is it possible?\" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards\\nhim; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called\\nat Mrs. Goddard's in his way.\\n\\n\"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and\\nat the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.\"\\n\\nEmma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more\\ncomposure,\\n\\n\"_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\\nhad your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\\nme a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking voice\\nand a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.\"\\n\\nFor a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of having\\nexcited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn within\\nhis, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying, in a tone\\nof great sensibility, speaking low,\\n\\n\"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent\\nsense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know you will not allow\\nyourself--.\" Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more\\nbroken and subdued accent, \"The feelings of the warmest\\nfriendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!\"--And in a louder,\\nsteadier tone, he concluded with, \"He will soon be gone. They will soon\\nbe in Yorkshire. I am sorry for _her_. She deserves a better fate.\"\\n\\nEmma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter\\nof pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\\n\\n\"You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--\\nI am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was\\ngoing on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed\\nof, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may\\nwell lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason\\nto regret that I was not in the secret earlier.\"\\n\\n\"Emma!\" cried he, looking eagerly at her, \"are you, indeed?\"--but\\nchecking himself--\"No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am pleased\\nthat you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret, indeed! and\\nit will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment\\nof more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not\\nfarther entangled!--I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure\\nmyself as to the degree of what you felt--I could only be certain that\\nthere was a preference--and a preference which I never believed him to\\ndeserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded\\nwith that sweet young woman?--Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable\\ncreature.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--\"I\\nam in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your\\nerror; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I\\nhave as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been\\nat all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural\\nfor a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--But I never\\nhave.\"\\n\\nHe listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would\\nnot. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his\\nclemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in\\nhis opinion. She went on, however.\\n\\n\"I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his\\nattentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--An old story,\\nprobably--a common case--and no more than has happened to hundreds of my\\nsex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up\\nas I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.\\nHe was the son of Mr. Weston--he was continually here--I always found\\nhim very pleasant--and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the\\ncauses ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last--my vanity\\nwas flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however--for some\\ntime, indeed--I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought\\nthem a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\\nHe has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been\\nattached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He\\nnever wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real\\nsituation with another.--It was his object to blind all about him; and\\nno one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself--except\\nthat I was _not_ blinded--that it was my good fortune--that, in short, I\\nwas somehow or other safe from him.\"\\n\\nShe had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her\\nconduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as she\\ncould judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual tone,\\nhe said,\\n\\n\"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,\\nhowever, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has\\nbeen but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he\\nmay yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have no\\nmotive for wishing him ill--and for her sake, whose happiness will be\\ninvolved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him\\nwell.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of their being happy together,\" said Emma; \"I believe\\nthem to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.\"\\n\\n\"He is a most fortunate man!\" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. \"So\\nearly in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man chuses a\\nwife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such\\na prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation,\\nhas before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman--the disinterested\\nlove, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her disinterestedness;\\nevery thing in his favour,--equality of situation--I mean, as far as\\nregards society, and all the habits and manners that are important;\\nequality in every point but one--and that one, since the purity of her\\nheart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it\\nwill be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would always\\nwish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from;\\nand he who can do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must,\\nI think, be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the\\nfavourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets\\nwith a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even\\nweary her by negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought\\nround the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found\\nher superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has only to\\nspeak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--He had used\\nevery body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--He is a\\nfortunate man indeed!\"\\n\\n\"You speak as if you envied him.\"\\n\\n\"And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.\"\\n\\nEmma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence\\nof Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if\\npossible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally\\ndifferent--the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for\\nbreath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,\\n\\n\"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined, I\\nsee, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma,\\nI must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the\\nnext moment.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,\" she eagerly cried. \"Take a\\nlittle time, consider, do not commit yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\\nanother syllable followed.\\n\\nEmma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in\\nher--perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.\\nShe might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give\\njust praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own independence,\\nrelieve him from that state of indecision, which must be more\\nintolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They had\\nreached the house.\\n\\n\"You are going in, I suppose?\" said he.\\n\\n\"No,\"--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which\\nhe still spoke--\"I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not\\ngone.\" And, after proceeding a few steps, she added--\"I stopped you\\nungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you\\npain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or\\nto ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation--as\\na friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like. I\\nwill tell you exactly what I think.\"\\n\\n\"As a friend!\"--repeated Mr. Knightley.--\"Emma, that I fear is a\\nword--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--I\\nhave gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your\\noffer--Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to\\nyou as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?\"\\n\\nHe stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\\nof his eyes overpowered her.\\n\\n\"My dearest Emma,\" said he, \"for dearest you will always be, whatever\\nthe event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved\\nEmma--tell me at once. Say 'No,' if it is to be said.\"--She could\\nreally say nothing.--\"You are silent,\" he cried, with great animation;\\n\"absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.\"\\n\\nEmma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The\\ndread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most\\nprominent feeling.\\n\\n\"I cannot make speeches, Emma:\" he soon resumed; and in a tone of\\nsuch sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably\\nconvincing.--\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it\\nmore. But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I\\nhave blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other\\nwoman in England would have borne it.--Bear with the truths I would\\ntell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The\\nmanner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have\\nbeen a very indifferent lover.--But you understand me.--Yes, you see,\\nyou understand my feelings--and will return them if you can. At present,\\nI ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.\"\\n\\nWhile he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\\nvelocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--to\\ncatch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet's\\nhopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a\\ndelusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing; that she was every\\nthing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet\\nhad been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her\\nagitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been all\\nreceived as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time\\nfor these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there\\nwas time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and\\nto resolve that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service\\nshe could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of\\nsentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his\\naffection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the\\ntwo--or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at\\nonce and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he could not\\nmarry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for Harriet, with pain and\\nwith contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that\\ncould be probable or reasonable, entered her brain. She had led her\\nfriend astray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her\\njudgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever\\nbeen before, in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal\\nand degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.--She spoke\\nthen, on being so entreated.--What did she say?--Just what she ought,\\nof course. A lady always does.--She said enough to shew there need not\\nbe despair--and to invite him to say more himself. He _had_ despaired at\\none period; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence,\\nas for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear\\nhim.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of\\ntaking another turn, her renewing the conversation which she had\\njust put an end to, might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its\\ninconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it,\\nand seek no farther explanation.\\n\\nSeldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;\\nseldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a\\nlittle mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is\\nmistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--Mr.\\nKnightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she\\npossessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\\n\\nHe had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had\\nfollowed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come,\\nin his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no\\nselfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an\\nopening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of\\nthe moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. The\\ndelightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill,\\nof her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth\\nto the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;--but\\nit had been no present hope--he had only, in the momentary conquest of\\neagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not forbid his\\nattempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were\\nso much the more enchanting.--The affection, which he had been asking\\nto be allowed to create, if he could, was already his!--Within half\\nan hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to\\nsomething so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.\\n\\n_Her_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the same\\nprecious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same\\ndegree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side, there had been\\na long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,\\nof Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank\\nChurchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably\\nenlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill\\nthat had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided\\nhim on going away. He would save himself from witnessing again\\nsuch permitted, encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be\\nindifferent.--But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much\\ndomestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form\\nin it; Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking\\ninferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before\\nhim, for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had\\nstayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's\\npost had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the gladness\\nwhich must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having never\\nbelieved Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much\\nfond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay no\\nlonger. He had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly\\nafter dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures,\\nfaultless in spite of all her faults, bore the discovery.\\n\\nHe had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--\\nHe heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill's\\ncharacter was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\\nwhen they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of Frank\\nChurchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nWhat totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from\\nwhat she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope for\\na little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite flutter of\\nhappiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be\\ngreater when the flutter should have passed away.\\n\\nThey sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--how often\\nit had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen on the same\\nshrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the\\nwestern sun!--But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing\\nlike it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her\\nusual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive\\ndaughter.\\n\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the\\nbreast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously\\nhoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he have seen the\\nheart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the\\nmost distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest\\nperception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either,\\nhe repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had\\nreceived from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment,\\ntotally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return.\\n\\nAs long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;\\nbut when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and\\nsubdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax\\nfor such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points\\nto consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some\\nalloy. Her father--and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling\\nthe full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort\\nof both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father,\\nit was a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley\\nwould ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most\\nsolemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept over\\nthe idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an\\nengagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of\\ndrawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--How\\nto do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--how to spare\\nher from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;\\nhow to appear least her enemy?--On these subjects, her perplexity\\nand distress were very great--and her mind had to pass again and\\nagain through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever\\nsurrounded it.--She could only resolve at last, that she would still\\navoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by\\nletter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed\\njust now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme\\nmore--nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\\nfor her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\\nand a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--She did\\nnot think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited by novelty\\nand variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--At any rate,\\nit would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom\\nevery thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the\\nevil day, when they must all be together again.\\n\\nShe rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which\\nleft her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking\\nup to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half\\nan hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,\\nliterally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a\\nproper share of the happiness of the evening before.\\n\\nHe had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the\\nslightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was\\nbrought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed what it\\nmust contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--She was now\\nin perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she\\nwanted only to have her thoughts to herself--and as for understanding\\nany thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.--It must be\\nwaded through, however. She opened the packet; it was too surely so;--a\\nnote from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to\\nMrs. Weston.\\n\\n\"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the\\nenclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcely\\na doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall never materially disagree\\nabout the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We\\nare quite well.--This letter has been the cure of all the little\\nnervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks\\non Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never\\nown being affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east\\nwind.--I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday\\nafternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing last\\nnight, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.\\n\\n                              \"Yours ever,\\n                                                       \"A.

My courage\\nrises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be\\nhumble. I have already met with such success in two applications for\\npardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,\\nand of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.--You\\nmust all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I\\nfirst arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret which\\nwas to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to place\\nmyself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.\\nI shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it a right,\\nI refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and\\ncasements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my\\ndifficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to\\nrequire definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we\\nparted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the\\ncreation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--Had she refused, I\\nshould have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say, what was your\\nhope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--To any thing, every\\nthing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,\\nperseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of\\ngood was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining her\\npromises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther explanation,\\nI have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband's son, and\\nthe advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good, which no\\ninheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See\\nme, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit to\\nRandalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have\\nbeen sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come till\\nMiss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person slighted, you\\nwill forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion, by\\nreminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house, so long\\nI lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour, during the very\\nhappy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open to\\nreprehension, excepting on one point. And now I come to the principal,\\nthe only important part of my conduct while belonging to you, which\\nexcites my own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation. With\\nthe greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss\\nWoodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest\\nhumiliation.--A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his\\nopinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour\\nto Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--In order to\\nassist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than\\nan allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately\\nthrown.--I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but\\nI am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been\\nconvinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any\\nselfish views to go on.--Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is,\\nshe never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and\\nthat she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me,\\nwas as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with\\nan easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.\\nWe seemed to understand each other. From our relative situation, those\\nattentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse\\nbegan really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight,\\nI cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her, I remember that I was\\nwithin a moment of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not\\nwithout suspicion; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me,\\nat least in some degree.--She may not have surmised the whole, but her\\nquickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find,\\nwhenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it\\ndid not take her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it.\\nI remember her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude\\nfor her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--I hope this history of my conduct\\ntowards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation\\nof what you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against\\nEmma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and\\nprocure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes\\nof that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly\\naffection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as\\nmyself.--Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,\\nyou have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to\\nget my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\\nIf you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--Of\\nthe pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that\\nits being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would never\\nhave allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--The\\ndelicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam,\\nis much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly\\nhope, know her thoroughly yourself.--No description can describe her.\\nShe must tell you herself what she is--yet not by word, for never\\nwas there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own\\nmerit.--Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw,\\nI have heard from her.--She gives a good account of her own health; but\\nas she never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion\\nof her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread\\nof the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without\\ndelay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few\\nminutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and\\nI am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness or\\nmisery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her\\nexcellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy:\\nbut when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little\\nI deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her\\nagain!--But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me\\nto encroach.--I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard\\nall that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail\\nyesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness\\nwith which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event\\nof the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the\\nhappiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures,\\nbut from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to\\nlose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she\\nwould have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and\\nrefinement.--But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had entered\\ninto with that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off\\nabruptly, to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over\\nthe country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of\\nmy letter what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying\\nretrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, that\\nmy manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly\\nblameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My\\nplea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was\\ndispleased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand\\noccasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even\\ncold. But she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, and\\nsubdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have\\nescaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--\\nDo you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every little\\ndissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late;\\nI met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she\\nwould not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then\\nthought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very\\nnatural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind the\\nworld to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable\\nparticularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a\\nproposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had we\\nbeen met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must\\nhave been suspected.--I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted\\nher affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when,\\nprovoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect\\nof her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been\\nimpossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in\\na form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--In short, my dear\\nmadam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and\\nI returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with\\nyou till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with\\nher as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to\\nbe reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her\\ncoldness, and I went away determined that she should make the first\\nadvances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of\\nthe Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly\\nsuppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon\\nher appears in the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she\\nfound I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that\\nofficious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the\\nbye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel\\nwith a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards\\nmyself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it\\nwhich that woman has known.--'Jane,' indeed!--You will observe that I\\nhave not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you.\\nThink, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between\\nthe Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the\\ninsolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon\\nhave done.--She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me\\nentirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet\\nagain.--_She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_\\n_repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.--This\\nletter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. I\\nanswered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the\\nmultiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of\\nbeing sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in\\nmy writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but\\na few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was\\nrather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; but I\\nmade excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--too cheerful\\nin my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor; and two\\ndays afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters all\\nreturned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her\\nextreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; and\\nadding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued,\\nand as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate\\narrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe\\nconveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directly\\ncommand hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I would\\nforward them after that period to her at--: in short, the full direction\\nto Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face. I knew the\\nname, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had\\nbeen doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character\\nwhich I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as to\\nany such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of its\\nanxious delicacy. For the world would not she have seemed to threaten\\nme.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my\\nown blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--What was to be\\ndone?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle. Without his sanction I\\ncould not hope to be listened to again.--I spoke; circumstances were\\nin my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was,\\nearlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying;\\nand could say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished I\\nmight find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I\\nfelt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity\\nme for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my\\nsuspense while all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached\\nHighbury, and saw how ill I had made her. Do not pity me till I saw her\\nwan, sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my\\nknowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance\\nof finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was not\\ndisappointed either in the object of my journey. A great deal of very\\nreasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away. But it is\\ndone; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever, and no moment's\\nuneasiness can ever occur between us again. Now, my dear madam, I will\\nrelease you; but I could not conclude before. A thousand and a thousand\\nthanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me, and ten thousand for\\nthe attentions your heart will dictate towards her.--If you think me in\\na way to be happier than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss\\nW. calls me the child of good fortune. I hope she is right.--In one\\nrespect, my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe\\nmyself,\\n\\n                    Your obliged and affectionate Son,\\n\\n                                          F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nThis letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She was obliged, in\\nspite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the\\njustice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name,\\nit was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting,\\nand almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject\\ncould still maintain itself, by the natural return of her former regard\\nfor the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of\\nlove must have for her at that moment. She never stopt till she had gone\\nthrough the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had\\nbeen wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had\\nsuffered, and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and\\nso much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that\\nthere was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must\\nhave shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.\\n\\nShe thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\\nshe desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to\\nbe communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so\\nmuch to blame in his conduct.\\n\\n\"I shall be very glad to look it over,\" said he; \"but it seems long. I\\nwill take it home with me at night.\"\\n\\nBut that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she\\nmust return it by him.\\n\\n\"I would rather be talking to you,\" he replied; \"but as it seems a\\nmatter of justice, it shall be done.\"\\n\\nHe began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, \"Had I been offered\\nthe sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few\\nmonths ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.\"\\n\\nHe proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a\\nsmile, observed, \"Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his\\nway. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not be\\nsevere.\"\\n\\n\"It will be natural for me,\" he added shortly afterwards, \"to speak my\\nopinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\\nIt will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it--\"\\n\\n\"Not at all. I should wish it.\"\\n\\nMr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.\\n\\n\"He trifles here,\" said he, \"as to the temptation. He knows he is wrong,\\nand has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the\\nengagement.--'His father's disposition:'--he is unjust, however, to his\\nfather. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright\\nand honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort\\nbefore he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss\\nFairfax was here.\"\\n\\n\"And I have not forgotten,\" said Emma, \"how sure you were that he might\\nhave come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely--but you\\nwere perfectly right.\"\\n\\n\"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--had\\n_you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him.\"\\n\\nWhen he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it\\naloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the\\nhead; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as\\nthe subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady\\nreflection, thus--\\n\\n\"Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous\\ngame. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--No judge of\\nhis own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and\\nregardless of little besides his own convenience.--Fancying you to have\\nfathomed his secret. Natural enough!--his own mind full of intrigue,\\nthat he should suspect it in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert\\nthe understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more\\nand more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each\\nother?\"\\n\\nEmma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,\\nwhich she could not give any sincere explanation of.\\n\\n\"You had better go on,\" said she.\\n\\nHe did so, but very soon stopt again to say, \"the pianoforte! Ah! That\\nwas the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether\\nthe inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. A\\nboyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a\\nwoman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense\\nwith; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument's\\ncoming if she could.\"\\n\\nAfter this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill's\\nconfession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for\\nmore than a word in passing.\\n\\n\"I perfectly agree with you, sir,\"--was then his remark. \"You did behave\\nvery shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.\" And having gone through\\nwhat immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his\\npersisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right,\\nhe made a fuller pause to say, \"This is very bad.--He had induced her\\nto place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and\\nuneasiness, and it should have been his first object to prevent her from\\nsuffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend\\nwith, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He should have\\nrespected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were\\nall reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember that she\\nhad done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she\\nshould have been in such a state of punishment.\"\\n\\nEmma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew\\nuncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was\\ndeeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,\\nhowever, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,\\nexcepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear\\nof giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.\\n\\n\"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the\\nEltons,\" was his next observation.--\"His feelings are natural.--What!\\nactually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement to\\nbe a source of repentance and misery to each--she dissolved it.--What a\\nview this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well, he must be a most\\nextraordinary--\"\\n\\n\"Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers.\"\\n\\n\"I hope he does,\" replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.\\n\"'Smallridge!'--What does this mean? What is all this?\"\\n\\n\"She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--a\\ndear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the\\nbye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?\"\\n\\n\"Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even of\\nMrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter\\nthe man writes!\"\\n\\n\"I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, there _is_ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in\\nfinding her ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of\\nher. 'Dearer, much dearer than ever.' I hope he may long continue to\\nfeel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal\\nthanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.--'Happier than I\\ndeserve.' Come, he knows himself there. 'Miss Woodhouse calls me the\\nchild of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?--\\nAnd a fine ending--and there is the letter. The child of good fortune!\\nThat was your name for him, was it?\"\\n\\n\"You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still\\nyou must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I\\nhope it does him some service with you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of\\ninconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion\\nin thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he\\nis, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it\\nmay be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am very\\nready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers the\\nsteadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me talk\\nto you of something else. I have another person's interest at present\\nso much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.\\nEver since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work\\non one subject.\"\\n\\nThe subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike\\nEnglish, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love\\nwith, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\\nhappiness of her father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word.\\n\"While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible\\nfor her. She could never quit him.\" Part only of this answer, however,\\nwas admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her father, Mr.\\nKnightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of any\\nother change, he could not agree to. He had been thinking it over most\\ndeeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to\\nremove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, but\\nhis knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself\\nlong; and now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation\\nwould be a risk of her father's comfort, perhaps even of his life, which\\nmust not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt\\nthat it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the\\nsacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any\\nrespect objectionable; it was, that he should be received at Hartfield;\\nthat so long as her father's happiness--in other words, his life--required\\nHartfield to continue her home, it should be his likewise.\\n\\nOf their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing\\nthoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such\\nan alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all\\nthe affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must\\nbe sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that\\nin living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there\\nwould be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of it,\\nand advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no\\nreflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject. He had\\ngiven it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration; he had\\nbeen walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his\\nthoughts to himself.\\n\\n\"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,\" cried Emma. \"I am sure\\nWilliam Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you\\nask mine.\"\\n\\nShe promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,\\nmoreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good\\nscheme.\\n\\nIt is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in\\nwhich she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never\\nstruck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as\\nheir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she must\\nof the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she only\\ngave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in\\ndetecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley's\\nmarrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had\\nwholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.\\n\\nThis proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at\\nHartfield--the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\\nHis evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual\\ngood to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in the\\nperiods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--Such a partner in\\nall those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of\\nmelancholy!\\n\\nShe would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing\\nof her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend,\\nwho must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family\\nparty which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere\\ncharitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in\\nevery way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction\\nfrom her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a\\ndead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a\\npeculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of\\nunmerited punishment.\\n\\nIn time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\\nsupplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.\\nKnightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--not\\nlike Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly\\nconsiderate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped\\nthan now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she\\ncould be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nIt was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as\\nherself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by\\nletter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\\n\\nHarriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without\\nreproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there\\nwas a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her style,\\nwhich increased the desirableness of their being separate.--It might be\\nonly her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have\\nbeen quite without resentment under such a stroke.\\n\\nShe had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and she was\\nfortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting\\nto invention.--There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and\\nhad wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was\\ndelighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to\\nher--and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was\\nquite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled\\non her sister's side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her\\nvery persuadable.--Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a\\nfortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was\\nall arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick\\nSquare.\\n\\nNow Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she could\\ntalk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense\\nof injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her\\nwhen remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might\\nat that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings\\nwhich she had led astray herself.\\n\\nThe difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps\\nan unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not think\\nof her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must\\nbe averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\\n\\nShe would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\\nin her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication before\\nher, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--the confession of\\nher engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it\\nat present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston\\nwere safe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at this\\nperiod among those she loved--and the evil should not act on herself\\nby anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of\\nleisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating,\\ndelight, should be hers.\\n\\nShe soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an\\nhour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--She ought\\nto go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present\\nsituations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a\\n_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect\\nwould certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any\\nthing Jane might communicate.\\n\\nShe went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not\\nbeen into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had\\nbeen in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the\\nworst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--The fear of being still\\nunwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home, to\\nwait in the passage, and send up her name.--She heard Patty announcing\\nit; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so\\nhappily intelligible.--No; she heard nothing but the instant reply of,\\n\"Beg her to walk up;\"--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs\\nby Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her\\nwere felt sufficient.--Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely,\\nso engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was\\nevery thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--\\nShe came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very\\nfeeling tone,\\n\\n\"This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me\\nto express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirely\\nwithout words.\"\\n\\nEmma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the\\nsound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked\\nher, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her\\ncongratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.\\n\\nMrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which\\naccounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.\\nElton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every\\nbody; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped the\\nrencontre would do them no harm.\\n\\nShe soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and\\nunderstand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in\\nMiss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was\\nstill a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in\\nthe expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs.\\nBates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw\\nher with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she\\nhad apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into\\nthe purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,\\n\\n\"We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want\\nopportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. I\\nonly wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is\\nnot offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet\\ncreature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.--But not a word\\nmore. Let us be discreet--quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You\\nremember those lines--I forget the poem at this moment:\\n\\n        \"For when a lady's in the case,\\n        \"You know all other things give place.\"\\n\\nNow I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word to\\nthe wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I want to set\\nyour heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see, has\\nquite appeased her.\"\\n\\nAnd again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates's\\nknitting, she added, in a half whisper,\\n\\n\"I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as a\\nminister of state. I managed it extremely well.\"\\n\\nEmma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every\\npossible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony of\\nthe weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,\\n\\n\"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\\ncharmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest\\ncredit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my\\nword, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--Oh! if you had\\nseen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!\"--And when Mrs. Bates\\nwas saying something to Emma, whispered farther, \"We do not say a word\\nof any _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young\\nphysician from Windsor.--Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.\"\\n\\n\"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\" she\\nshortly afterwards began, \"since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant\\nparty. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not\\nseem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So\\nit appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think\\nit answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to our\\ncollecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while the\\nfine weather lasts?--It must be the same party, you know, quite the\\nsame party, not _one_ exception.\"\\n\\nSoon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being\\ndiverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,\\nshe supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say\\nevery thing.\\n\\n\"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible\\nto say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--that\\nis, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--How is Mr.\\nWoodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--Such a happy little\\ncircle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--Charming young man!--that\\nis--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--such attention to\\nJane!\"--And from her great, her more than commonly thankful delight\\ntowards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed that there had been a\\nlittle show of resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter,\\nwhich was now graciously overcome.--After a few whispers, indeed, which\\nplaced it beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\\n\\n\"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that\\nanywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth\\nis, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me\\nhere, and pay his respects to you.\"\\n\\n\"What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--That will\\nbe a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits, and\\nMr. Elton's time is so engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning to\\nnight.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretence or\\nother.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always\\nwanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without\\nhim.--'Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, 'rather you than I.--I do\\nnot know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had\\nhalf so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect\\nthem both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar\\nthis fortnight.--However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on\\npurpose to wait on you all.\" And putting up her hand to screen her\\nwords from Emma--\"A congratulatory visit, you know.--Oh! yes, quite\\nindispensable.\"\\n\\nMiss Bates looked about her, so happily--!\\n\\n\"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself\\nfrom Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep\\nconsultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand.\"\\n\\nEmma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, \"Is Mr. Elton\\ngone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and\\nCole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who\\nlead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.\"\\n\\n\"Have not you mistaken the day?\" said Emma. \"I am almost certain that\\nthe meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley was at\\nHartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,\" was the abrupt answer, which\\ndenoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--\"I do\\nbelieve,\" she continued, \"this is the most troublesome parish that ever\\nwas. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.\"\\n\\n\"Your parish there was small,\" said Jane.\\n\\n\"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\\ntalked of.\"\\n\\n\"But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard\\nyou speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the\\nonly school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking brain you\\nhave! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if we\\ncould be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce\\nperfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that _some_\\npeople may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--not a word,\\nif you please.\"\\n\\nIt seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,\\nnot to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\\nThe wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very\\nevident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\\n\\nMr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her\\nsparkling vivacity.\\n\\n\"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\\nencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--But\\nyou knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I should\\nnot stir till my lord and master appeared.--Here have I been sitting\\nthis hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal\\nobedience--for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?\"\\n\\nMr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\\nHis civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\\nobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and the\\nwalk he had had for nothing.\\n\\n\"When I got to Donwell,\" said he, \"Knightley could not be found. Very\\nodd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and the\\nmessage he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.\"\\n\\n\"Donwell!\" cried his wife.--\"My dear Mr. E., you have not been to\\nDonwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\\nto-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--I went\\nover the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made\\nit so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you\\nI am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The\\nhousekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--Very\\nextraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps\\nto Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--Miss\\nWoodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it?\"\\n\\nEmma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\\nindeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine,\" said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\\nought to do,) \"I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of\\nall people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to\\nbe forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am\\nsure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--and his\\nservants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely\\nto happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed,\\nextremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a\\ncreature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And\\nas for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised\\nWright a receipt, and never sent it.\"\\n\\n\"I met William Larkins,\" continued Mr. Elton, \"as I got near the house,\\nand he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not\\nbelieve him.--William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what\\nwas come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the\\nspeech of him. I have nothing to do with William's wants, but it really\\nis of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to-day; and it\\nbecomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should\\nhave had this hot walk to no purpose.\"\\n\\nEmma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In\\nall probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.\\nKnightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards\\nMr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\\n\\nShe was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to\\nattend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her\\nan opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,\\n\\n\"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you\\nnot been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to\\nintroduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might\\nhave been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have been\\nimpertinent.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\\ninfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual\\ncomposure--\"there would have been no danger. The danger would have\\nbeen of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than\\nby expressing an interest--. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more\\ncollectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very\\ngreat misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those\\nof my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not\\ndisgusted to such a degree as to--I have not time for half that I could\\nwish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for\\nmyself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if your\\ncompassion does not stand my friend--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,\" cried Emma warmly, and\\ntaking her hand. \"You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you\\nmight be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted\\neven--\"\\n\\n\"You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--So\\ncold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life of\\ndeceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.\"\\n\\n\"Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\\nLet us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done\\nquickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you\\nhave pleasant accounts from Windsor?\"\\n\\n\"Very.\"\\n\\n\"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--just as\\nI begin to know you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here\\ntill claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,\" replied Emma,\\nsmiling--\"but, excuse me, it must be thought of.\"\\n\\nThe smile was returned as Jane answered,\\n\\n\"You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I\\nam sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill\\nat Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of\\ndeep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing\\nmore to wait for.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured\\nof.--Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and\\nopen!--Good-bye, good-bye.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nMrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the\\nsatisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by\\nknowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in\\nwishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with\\nany view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's\\nsons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father\\nand mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew\\nolder--and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to\\nhave his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks\\nand the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--no\\none could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would be\\nquite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have\\ntheir powers in exercise again.\\n\\n\"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,\" she\\ncontinued--\"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, in Madame\\nde Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little\\nAdelaide educated on a more perfect plan.\"\\n\\n\"That is,\" replied Mr. Knightley, \"she will indulge her even more than\\nshe did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will\\nbe the only difference.\"\\n\\n\"Poor child!\" cried Emma; \"at that rate, what will become of her?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable\\nin infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my\\nbitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing all\\nmy happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be\\nsevere on them?\"\\n\\nEmma laughed, and replied: \"But I had the assistance of all your\\nendeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt whether\\nmy own sense would have corrected me without it.\"\\n\\n\"Do you?--I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:--Miss Taylor\\ngave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite\\nas likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what\\nright has he to lecture me?--and I am afraid very natural for you to\\nfeel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did\\nyou any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the\\ntenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without\\ndoating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,\\nhave been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure you were of use to me,\" cried Emma. \"I was very often\\ninfluenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time. I\\nam very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be\\nspoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her\\nas you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is\\nthirteen.\"\\n\\n\"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your\\nsaucy looks--'Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I\\nmay, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which, you knew, I\\ndid not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad\\nfeelings instead of one.\"\\n\\n\"What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches\\nin such affectionate remembrance.\"\\n\\n\"'Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, 'Mr. Knightley;' and, from\\nhabit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal. I want\\nyou to call me something else, but I do not know what.\"\\n\\n\"I remember once calling you 'George,' in one of my amiable fits, about\\nten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as\\nyou made no objection, I never did it again.\"\\n\\n\"And cannot you call me 'George' now?\"\\n\\n\"Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but 'Mr. Knightley.' I\\nwill not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by\\ncalling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,\" she added presently, laughing\\nand blushing--\"I will promise to call you once by your Christian name.\\nI do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in\\nwhich N. takes M. for better, for worse.\"\\n\\nEmma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important\\nservice which his better sense would have rendered her, to the\\nadvice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly\\nfollies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a\\nsubject.--She could not enter on it.--Harriet was very seldom mentioned\\nbetween them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not being\\nthought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy,\\nand a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were\\ndeclining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other\\ncircumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that\\nher intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on\\nIsabella's letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being\\nobliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior to\\nthe pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\\n\\nIsabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be\\nexpected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which\\nappeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but,\\nsince that business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet\\ndifferent from what she had known her before.--Isabella, to be sure,\\nwas no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing\\nwith the children, it would not have escaped her. Emma's comforts and\\nhopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer;\\nher fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John\\nKnightley were to come down in August, and she was invited to remain\\ntill they could bring her back.\\n\\n\"John does not even mention your friend,\" said Mr. Knightley. \"Here is\\nhis answer, if you like to see it.\"\\n\\nIt was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emma\\naccepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know\\nwhat he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her\\nfriend was unmentioned.\\n\\n\"John enters like a brother into my happiness,\" continued Mr. Knightley,\\n\"but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,\\nlikewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from making\\nflourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather cool in\\nher praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.\"\\n\\n\"He writes like a sensible man,\" replied Emma, when she had read the\\nletter. \"I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers the\\ngood fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not\\nwithout hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as\\nyou think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a different\\nconstruction, I should not have believed him.\"\\n\\n\"My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means--\"\\n\\n\"He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,\"\\ninterrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--\"much less, perhaps, than\\nhe is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the\\nsubject.\"\\n\\n\"Emma, my dear Emma--\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" she cried with more thorough gaiety, \"if you fancy your brother\\ndoes not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,\\nand hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from doing\\n_you_ justice. He will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on\\nyour side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not\\nsink into 'poor Emma' with him at once.--His tender compassion towards\\noppressed worth can go no farther.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" he cried, \"I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as\\nJohn will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give, to be\\nhappy together. I am amused by one part of John's letter--did you notice\\nit?--where he says, that my information did not take him wholly by\\nsurprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the\\nkind.\"\\n\\n\"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having\\nsome thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly\\nunprepared for that.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my\\nfeelings. What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious of any\\ndifference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at\\nthis time for my marrying any more than at another.--But it was so, I\\nsuppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them\\nthe other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much\\nas usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, 'Uncle seems\\nalways tired now.'\"\\n\\nThe time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other\\npersons' reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\\nrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view that\\nher gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to\\nannounce it at home, and then at Randalls.--But how to break it to her\\nfather at last!--She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr.\\nKnightley's absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have\\nfailed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come\\nat such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was\\nforced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a\\nmore decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\\nShe must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she\\ncould command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,\\nin a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be\\nobtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,\\nsince it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--she and Mr.\\nKnightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the\\nconstant addition of that person's company whom she knew he loved, next\\nto his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.\\n\\nPoor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\\nearnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of\\nhaving always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be\\na great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella,\\nand poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do. Emma hung about him\\naffectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must\\nnot class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them\\nfrom Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not\\ngoing from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing\\nno change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she\\nwas very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr.\\nKnightley always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.--Did\\nhe not love Mr. Knightley very much?--He would not deny that he did,\\nshe was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr.\\nKnightley?--Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his letters,\\nwho so glad to assist him?--Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached\\nto him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes. That\\nwas all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should\\nbe glad to see him every day;--but they did see him every day as it\\nwas.--Why could not they go on as they had done?\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\\nthe idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--To\\nEmma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fond\\npraise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon\\nused to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--They had all\\nthe assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest\\napprobation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to\\nconsider the subject in the most serviceable light--first, as a settled,\\nand, secondly, as a good one--well aware of the nearly equal importance\\nof the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed\\nupon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be\\nguided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some\\nfeelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some\\ntime or other--in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very\\nbad if the marriage did take place.\\n\\nMrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\\nsaid to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,\\nnever more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she\\nsaw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in\\nurging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as\\nto think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect\\nso proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one\\nrespect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,\\nso singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely\\nhave attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself\\nbeen the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it\\nlong ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma\\nwould have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.\\nKnightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such\\nan arrangement desirable!--The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.\\nWoodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, for\\na marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe\\nand Hartfield had been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr.\\nWeston than by herself--but even he had never been able to finish\\nthe subject better than by saying--\"Those matters will take care of\\nthemselves; the young people will find a way.\" But here there was\\nnothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was\\nall right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name.\\nIt was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without\\none real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.\\n\\nMrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\\nas these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing could\\nincrease her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon have\\noutgrown its first set of caps.\\n\\nThe news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston\\nhad his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to\\nfamiliarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--He saw the advantages\\nof the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife;\\nbut the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he\\nwas not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.\\n\\n\"It is to be a secret, I conclude,\" said he. \"These matters are always a\\nsecret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me be\\ntold when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.\"\\n\\nHe went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that\\npoint. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest\\ndaughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed,\\nof course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately\\nafterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they\\nhad calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon it\\nwould be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening\\nwonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.\\n\\nIn general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him, and\\nothers might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend their\\nall removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys;\\nand another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet,\\nupon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one\\nhabitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprize was not softened by any\\nsatisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife;\\nhe only hoped \"the young lady's pride would now be contented;\" and\\nsupposed \"she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could;\" and,\\non the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, \"Rather\\nhe than I!\"--But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--\"Poor\\nKnightley! poor fellow!--sad business for him.\"--She was extremely\\nconcerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good\\nqualities.--How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in\\nlove--not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all\\npleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine\\nwith them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.--Poor\\nfellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_. Oh!\\nno; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every\\nthing.--Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that\\nshe had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan, living\\ntogether. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who\\nhad tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first\\nquarter.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nTime passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would\\nbe arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one\\nmorning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her, when\\nMr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the\\nfirst chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began\\nwith,\\n\\n\"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.\"\\n\\n\"Good or bad?\" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\\n\\n\"I do not know which it ought to be called.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance. You are trying not\\nto smile.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" said he, composing his features, \"I am very much afraid,\\nmy dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases\\nor amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.\"\\n\\n\"There is one subject,\" he replied, \"I hope but one, on which we do not\\nthink alike.\" He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on\\nher face. \"Does nothing occur to you?--Do not you recollect?--Harriet\\nSmith.\"\\n\\nHer cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, though\\nshe knew not what.\\n\\n\"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?\" cried he. \"You have, I\\nbelieve, and know the whole.\"\\n\\n\"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.\"\\n\\n\"You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. Harriet\\nSmith marries Robert Martin.\"\\n\\nEmma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and her eyes,\\nin eager gaze, said, \"No, this is impossible!\" but her lips were closed.\\n\\n\"It is so, indeed,\" continued Mr. Knightley; \"I have it from Robert\\nMartin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.\"\\n\\nShe was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\\n\\n\"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were\\nthe same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one\\nor the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not\\ntalk much on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"You mistake me, you quite mistake me,\" she replied, exerting herself.\\n\"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I\\ncannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean to say,\\nthat Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he\\nhas even proposed to her again--yet. You only mean, that he intends it.\"\\n\\n\"I mean that he has done it,\" answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but\\ndetermined decision, \"and been accepted.\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" she cried.--\"Well!\"--Then having recourse to her workbasket,\\nin excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite\\nfeelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be\\nexpressing, she added, \"Well, now tell me every thing; make this\\nintelligible to me. How, where, when?--Let me know it all. I never was\\nmore surprized--but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.--How--how\\nhas it been possible?\"\\n\\n\"It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,\\nand I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send\\nto John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was\\nasked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's. They were\\ngoing to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to be our\\nbrother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could\\nnot resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused;\\nand my brother asked him to dine with them the next day--which he\\ndid--and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an\\nopportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak\\nin vain.--She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is\\ndeserving. He came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this\\nmorning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first\\non my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of\\nthe how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much\\nlonger history when you see her.--She will give you all the minute\\nparticulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.--In our\\ncommunications we deal only in the great.--However, I must say, that\\nRobert Martin's heart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing;\\nand that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that\\non quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John\\nKnightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\\nand that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\\nrather uneasy.\"\\n\\nHe stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she\\nwas sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.\\nShe must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence disturbed\\nhim; and after observing her a little while, he added,\\n\\n\"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you\\nunhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His\\nsituation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies your\\nfriend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him\\nas you know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight\\nyou.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend\\nin better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is\\nsaying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me about William\\nLarkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.\"\\n\\nHe wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not\\nto smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,\\n\\n\"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think\\nHarriet is doing extremely well. _Her_ connexions may be worse than\\n_his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they\\nare. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You\\ncannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared\\nI was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined\\nagainst him, much more, than she was before.\"\\n\\n\"You ought to know your friend best,\" replied Mr. Knightley; \"but I\\nshould say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be\\nvery, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.\"\\n\\nEmma could not help laughing as she answered, \"Upon my word, I believe\\nyou know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley, are you\\nperfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him.\\nI could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--Did not you\\nmisunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things; of business,\\nshows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you, in the confusion of\\nso many subjects, mistake him?--It was not Harriet's hand that he was\\ncertain of--it was the dimensions of some famous ox.\"\\n\\nThe contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert\\nMartin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so strong\\nwas the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet's\\nside, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis,\\n\"No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,\" that she was\\nreally expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature.\\nIt could not be otherwise.\\n\\n\"Do you dare say this?\" cried Mr. Knightley. \"Do you dare to suppose me\\nso great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--What do\\nyou deserve?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with\\nany other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are\\nyou quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and\\nHarriet now are?\"\\n\\n\"I am quite sure,\" he replied, speaking very distinctly, \"that he\\ntold me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing\\ndoubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that\\nit must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew\\nof no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of\\nher relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done,\\nthan to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then, he\\nsaid, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.\"\\n\\n\"I am perfectly satisfied,\" replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\\n\"and most sincerely wish them happy.\"\\n\\n\"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.\"\\n\\n\"I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.\"\\n\\n\"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\\nHarriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for\\nRobert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much\\nin love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have often\\ntalked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes,\\nindeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor\\nMartin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations,\\nI am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl, with very good\\nnotions, very seriously good principles, and placing her happiness in\\nthe affections and utility of domestic life.--Much of this, I have no\\ndoubt, she may thank you for.\"\\n\\n\"Me!\" cried Emma, shaking her head.--\"Ah! poor Harriet!\"\\n\\nShe checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more\\npraise than she deserved.\\n\\nTheir conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her\\nfather. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a\\nstate of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be\\ncollected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till she\\nhad moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected, she\\ncould be fit for nothing rational.\\n\\nHer father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put the\\nhorses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she\\nhad, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\\n\\nThe joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be\\nimagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of\\nHarriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for\\nsecurity.--What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of\\nhim, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own.\\nNothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility\\nand circumspection in future.\\n\\nSerious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her\\nresolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the\\nvery midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the\\ndoleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart--such a Harriet!\\n\\nNow there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would be a\\npleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\\n\\nHigh in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the\\nreflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would\\nsoon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to\\npractise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving him\\nthat full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to\\nwelcome as a duty.\\n\\nIn the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not\\nalways listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in\\nspeech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his\\nbeing obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be\\ndisappointed.\\n\\nThey arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--but hardly\\nhad they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks\\nfor coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the\\nblind, of two figures passing near the window.\\n\\n\"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\" said Mrs. Weston. \"I was just going to\\ntell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning. He\\nstays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the\\nday with us.--They are coming in, I hope.\"\\n\\nIn half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to\\nsee him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassing\\nrecollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a\\nconsciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all\\nsat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that\\nEmma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had long\\nfelt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane,\\nwould yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the\\nparty, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a\\nwant of subject or animation--or of courage and opportunity for Frank\\nChurchill to draw near her and say,\\n\\n\"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message\\nin one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made you less\\nwilling to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" cried Emma, most happy to begin, \"not in the least. I am\\nparticularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy\\nin person.\"\\n\\nHe thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with\\nserious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\\n\\n\"Is not she looking well?\" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\\n\"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston\\ndoat upon her.\"\\n\\nBut his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after\\nmentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of\\nDixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.\\n\\n\"I can never think of it,\" she cried, \"without extreme shame.\"\\n\\n\"The shame,\" he answered, \"is all mine, or ought to be. But is it\\npossible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late. Early, I know, you\\nhad none.\"\\n\\n\"I never had the smallest, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near--and I wish I\\nhad--it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong\\nthings, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no\\nservice.--It would have been a much better transgression had I broken\\nthe bond of secrecy and told you every thing.\"\\n\\n\"It is not now worth a regret,\" said Emma.\\n\\n\"I have some hope,\" resumed he, \"of my uncle's being persuaded to pay a\\nvisit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells\\nare returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust,\\ntill we may carry her northward.--But now, I am at such a distance from\\nher--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--Till this morning, we have not\\nonce met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?\"\\n\\nEmma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay\\nthought, he cried,\\n\\n\"Ah! by the bye,\" then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the\\nmoment--\"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?\" He paused.--She coloured and\\nlaughed.--\"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish\\nin your favour. Let me return your congratulations.--I assure you that\\nI have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He is\\na man whom I cannot presume to praise.\"\\n\\nEmma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but\\nhis mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,\\nand his next words were,\\n\\n\"Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--and\\nyet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair. It is a\\nmost uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--a most\\ndistinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.--Just colour\\nenough for beauty.\"\\n\\n\"I have always admired her complexion,\" replied Emma, archly; \"but\\ndo not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so\\npale?--When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--\"\\n\\nBut he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help\\nsaying,\\n\\n\"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you\\nhad very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I am\\nsure it was a consolation to you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most\\nmiserable wretch!\"\\n\\n\"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was a\\nsource of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us\\nall in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the\\ntruth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same\\nsituation. I think there is a little likeness between us.\"\\n\\nHe bowed.\\n\\n\"If not in our dispositions,\" she presently added, with a look of true\\nsensibility, \"there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids\\nfair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own.\"\\n\\n\"True, true,\" he answered, warmly. \"No, not true on your side. You can\\nhave no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel. Look\\nat her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her\\nthroat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--You will\\nbe glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my\\nuncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels. They are to be new set.\\nI am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be\\nbeautiful in her dark hair?\"\\n\\n\"Very beautiful, indeed,\" replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that he\\ngratefully burst out,\\n\\n\"How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent\\nlooks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should\\ncertainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.\"\\n\\nThe others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account\\nof a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the\\ninfant's appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish,\\nbut it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of sending\\nfor Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been\\nalmost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes, however, the child had\\nbeen perfectly well again. This was her history; and particularly\\ninteresting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her very much for\\nthinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she had not done\\nit. \"She should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the\\nslightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She could not be\\ntoo soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps,\\nthat he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,\\nvery well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had\\nseen it.\"\\n\\nFrank Churchill caught the name.\\n\\n\"Perry!\" said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\\nFairfax's eye. \"My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.\\nPerry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has\\nhe set up his carriage?\"\\n\\nEmma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the\\nlaugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she too was really\\nhearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\\n\\n\"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!\" he cried. \"I can never think of\\nit without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see\\nit in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do\\nnot you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter,\\nwhich sent me the report, is passing under her eye--that the whole\\nblunder is spread before her--that she can attend to nothing else,\\nthough pretending to listen to the others?\"\\n\\nJane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly\\nremained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet\\nsteady voice,\\n\\n\"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--They\\n_will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!\"\\n\\nHe had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but\\nEmma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving\\nRandalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she\\nfelt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really\\nregarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more\\nsensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character. The happiness\\nof this most happy day, received its completion, in the animated\\ncontemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a\\nmomentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her\\nattachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from\\nunbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the\\nrecurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party\\nfrom London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour\\nalone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable\\nas it was!--that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\\nand was now forming all her views of happiness.\\n\\nHarriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\\nbut having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and\\nself-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with\\nthe words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the\\nfullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend's\\napprobation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by\\nmeeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--Harriet was\\nmost happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and the\\ndinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.\\nBut what did such particulars explain?--The fact was, as Emma could now\\nacknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his\\ncontinuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever\\nbe unintelligible to Emma.\\n\\nThe event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh\\nreason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known. She proved\\nto be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the\\ncomfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to\\nhave always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility\\nwhich Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--It was likely to\\nbe as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what\\na connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for the\\nChurchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--The stain of illegitimacy,\\nunbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.\\n\\nNo objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was treated\\nliberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted\\nwith Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully\\nacknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could\\nbid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet's\\nhappiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he\\noffered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and\\nimprovement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,\\nand who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety,\\nand occupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led into\\ntemptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectable\\nand happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the\\nworld, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a\\nman;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.\\n\\nHarriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\\nwas less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--The\\nintimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change\\ninto a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be,\\nand must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural\\nmanner.\\n\\nBefore the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\\nher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as\\nno remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them,\\ncould impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton,\\nbut as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on\\nherself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of\\nthe three, were the first to be married.\\n\\nJane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\\ncomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills\\nwere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.\\n\\nThe intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by\\nEmma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought\\nto be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to\\nallow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, which was\\nthe plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in\\napproving it. But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced\\nto consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a\\ndistant event.\\n\\nWhen first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were\\nalmost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--He\\nbegan to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--a very\\npromising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he\\nwas not happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter's\\ncourage failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to know\\nhim fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almost\\nacquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when\\nonce the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, she\\nhesitated--she could not proceed.\\n\\nIn this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\\nillumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his\\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another\\nway.--Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her\\nturkeys--evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in\\nthe neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.\\nWoodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his\\nson-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every\\nnight of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the\\nMr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of them\\nprotected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--But Mr. John Knightley must\\nbe in London again by the end of the first week in November.\\n\\nThe result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the\\nmoment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was called\\non, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to\\njoin the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.\\n\\nThe wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have\\nno taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars\\ndetailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very\\ninferior to her own.--\"Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a\\nmost pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it.\"--But,\\nin spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,\\nthe predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the\\nceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.\\n\\n\\n\\nFINIS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Emma, by Jane Austen\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EMMA ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 158.txt or 158.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/158/\\n\\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It was disposed of to a bookseller, it was even\\nadvertised, and why the business proceeded no farther, the author\\nhas never been able to learn. That any bookseller should think it\\nworth-while to purchase what he did not think it worth-while to publish\\nseems extraordinary. But with this, neither the author nor the public\\nhave any other concern than as some observation is necessary upon those\\nparts of the work which thirteen years have made comparatively obsolete.\\nThe public are entreated to bear in mind that thirteen years have passed\\nsince it was finished, many more since it was begun, and that during\\nthat period, places, manners, books, and opinions have undergone\\nconsiderable changes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 1\\n\\n\\nNo one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have\\nsupposed her born to be an heroine. Her situation in life, the character\\nof her father and mother, her own person and disposition, were\\nall equally against her. Her father was a clergyman, without being\\nneglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his name\\nwas Richard--and he had never been handsome. He had a considerable\\nindependence besides two good livings--and he was not in the least\\naddicted to locking up his daughters. Her mother was a woman of useful\\nplain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a\\ngood constitution. She had three sons before Catherine was born; and\\ninstead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might\\nexpect, she still lived on--lived to have six children more--to see them\\ngrowing up around her, and to enjoy excellent health herself. A family\\nof ten children will be always called a fine family, where there are\\nheads and arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands had\\nlittle other right to the word, for they were in general very plain, and\\nCatherine, for many years of her life, as plain as any. She had a thin\\nawkward figure, a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and strong\\nfeatures--so much for her person; and not less unpropitious for heroism\\nseemed her mind. She was fond of all boy's plays, and greatly preferred\\ncricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic enjoyments of\\ninfancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a\\nrose-bush. Indeed she had no taste for a garden; and if she gathered\\nflowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief--at least\\nso it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was\\nforbidden to take. Such were her propensities--her abilities were quite\\nas extraordinary. She never could learn or understand anything\\nbefore she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was often\\ninattentive, and occasionally stupid. Her mother was three months in\\nteaching her only to repeat the \"Beggar's Petition\"; and after all, her\\nnext sister, Sally, could say it better than she did. Not that Catherine\\nwas always stupid--by no means; she learnt the fable of \"The Hare and\\nMany Friends\" as quickly as any girl in England. Her mother wished her\\nto learn music; and Catherine was sure she should like it, for she was\\nvery fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet; so, at eight\\nyears old she began. She learnt a year, and could not bear it; and Mrs.\\nMorland, who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in\\nspite of incapacity or distaste, allowed her to leave off. The day which\\ndismissed the music-master was one of the happiest of Catherine's life.\\nHer taste for drawing was not superior; though whenever she could obtain\\nthe outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd\\npiece of paper, she did what she could in that way, by drawing houses\\nand trees, hens and chickens, all very much like one another. Writing\\nand accounts she was taught by her father; French by her mother: her\\nproficiency in either was not remarkable, and she shirked her lessons in\\nboth whenever she could. What a strange, unaccountable character!--for\\nwith all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old, she had neither\\na bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely ever\\nquarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones, with few interruptions\\nof tyranny; she was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement and\\ncleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the\\ngreen slope at the back of the house.\\n\\nSuch was Catherine Morland at ten. At fifteen, appearances were mending;\\nshe began to curl her hair and long for balls; her complexion improved,\\nher features were softened by plumpness and colour, her eyes gained more\\nanimation, and her figure more consequence. Her love of dirt gave way to\\nan inclination for finery, and she grew clean as she grew smart; she had\\nnow the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark\\non her personal improvement. \"Catherine grows quite a good-looking\\ngirl--she is almost pretty today,\" were words which caught her ears now\\nand then; and how welcome were the sounds! To look almost pretty is an\\nacquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the\\nfirst fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever\\nreceive.\\n\\nMrs. Morland was a very good woman, and wished to see her children\\neverything they ought to be; but her time was so much occupied in\\nlying-in and teaching the little ones, that her elder daughters were\\ninevitably left to shift for themselves; and it was not very wonderful\\nthat Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, should\\nprefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about\\nthe country at the age of fourteen, to books--or at least books of\\ninformation--for, provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be\\ngained from them, provided they were all story and no reflection, she\\nhad never any objection to books at all. But from fifteen to seventeen\\nshe was in training for a heroine; she read all such works as heroines\\nmust read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so\\nserviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives.\\n\\nFrom Pope, she learnt to censure those who\\n\\n   \"bear about the mockery of woe.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom Gray, that\\n\\n   \"Many a flower is born to blush unseen,\\n   \"And waste its fragrance on the desert air.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom Thompson, that--\\n\\n   \"It is a delightful task\\n   \"To teach the young idea how to shoot.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information--amongst\\nthe rest, that--\\n\\n   \"Trifles light as air,\\n   \"Are, to the jealous, confirmation strong,\\n   \"As proofs of Holy Writ.\"\\n\\n\\nThat\\n\\n   \"The poor beetle, which we tread upon,\\n   \"In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great\\n   \"As when a giant dies.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd that a young woman in love always looks--\\n\\n   \"like Patience on a monument\\n   \"Smiling at Grief.\"\\n\\n\\nSo far her improvement was sufficient--and in many other points she came\\non exceedingly well; for though she could not write sonnets, she brought\\nherself to read them; and though there seemed no chance of her throwing\\na whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of her own\\ncomposition, she could listen to other people's performance with very\\nlittle fatigue. Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil--she had no\\nnotion of drawing--not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover's\\nprofile, that she might be detected in the design. There she fell\\nmiserably short of the true heroic height. At present she did not know\\nher own poverty, for she had no lover to portray. She had reached the\\nage of seventeen, without having seen one amiable youth who could call\\nforth her sensibility, without having inspired one real passion, and\\nwithout having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate\\nand very transient. This was strange indeed! But strange things may be\\ngenerally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out. There was\\nnot one lord in the neighbourhood; no--not even a baronet. There was not\\none family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy\\naccidentally found at their door--not one young man whose origin\\nwas unknown. Her father had no ward, and the squire of the parish no\\nchildren.\\n\\nBut when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of forty\\nsurrounding families cannot prevent her. Something must and will happen\\nto throw a hero in her way.\\n\\nMr. Allen, who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton, the\\nvillage in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived, was ordered to Bath\\nfor the benefit of a gouty constitution--and his lady, a good-humoured\\nwoman, fond of Miss Morland, and probably aware that if adventures will\\nnot befall a young lady in her own village, she must seek them abroad,\\ninvited her to go with them. Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance,\\nand Catherine all happiness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\n\\nIn addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland's\\npersonal and mental endowments, when about to be launched into all the\\ndifficulties and dangers of a six weeks' residence in Bath, it may be\\nstated, for the reader's more certain information, lest the following\\npages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is\\nmeant to be, that her heart was affectionate; her disposition cheerful\\nand open, without conceit or affectation of any kind--her manners just\\nremoved from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl; her person pleasing,\\nand, when in good looks, pretty--and her mind about as ignorant and\\nuninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is.\\n\\nWhen the hour of departure drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs.\\nMorland will be naturally supposed to be most severe. A thousand\\nalarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this\\nterrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown her\\nin tears for the last day or two of their being together; and advice of\\nthe most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her\\nwise lips in their parting conference in her closet. Cautions against\\nthe violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young\\nladies away to some remote farm-house, must, at such a moment, relieve\\nthe fulness of her heart. Who would not think so? But Mrs. Morland knew\\nso little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of their\\ngeneral mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her\\ndaughter from their machinations. Her cautions were confined to the\\nfollowing points. \"I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up\\nvery warm about the throat, when you come from the rooms at night; and\\nI wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend; I will\\ngive you this little book on purpose.\"\\n\\nSally, or rather Sarah (for what young lady of common gentility will\\nreach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can?),\\nmust from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante\\nof her sister. It is remarkable, however, that she neither insisted\\non Catherine's writing by every post, nor exacted her promise of\\ntransmitting the character of every new acquaintance, nor a detail\\nof every interesting conversation that Bath might produce. Everything\\nindeed relative to this important journey was done, on the part of the\\nMorlands, with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed\\nrather consistent with the common feelings of common life, than with the\\nrefined susceptibilities, the tender emotions which the first separation\\nof a heroine from her family ought always to excite. Her father, instead\\nof giving her an unlimited order on his banker, or even putting an\\nhundred pounds bank-bill into her hands, gave her only ten guineas, and\\npromised her more when she wanted it.\\n\\nUnder these unpromising auspices, the parting took place, and the\\njourney began. It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful\\nsafety. Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them, nor one lucky\\noverturn to introduce them to the hero. Nothing more alarming occurred\\nthan a fear, on Mrs. Allen's side, of having once left her clogs behind\\nher at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be groundless.\\n\\nThey arrived at Bath. Catherine was all eager delight--her eyes were\\nhere, there, everywhere, as they approached its fine and striking\\nenvirons, and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted\\nthem to the hotel. She was come to be happy, and she felt happy already.\\n\\nThey were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street.\\n\\nIt is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen, that the\\nreader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter\\ntend to promote the general distress of the work, and how she will,\\nprobably, contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate\\nwretchedness of which a last volume is capable--whether by her\\nimprudence, vulgarity, or jealousy--whether by intercepting her letters,\\nruining her character, or turning her out of doors.\\n\\nMrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females, whose society can\\nraise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world\\nwho could like them well enough to marry them. She had neither beauty,\\ngenius, accomplishment, nor manner. The air of a gentlewoman, a great\\ndeal of quiet, inactive good temper, and a trifling turn of mind\\nwere all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible,\\nintelligent man like Mr. Allen. In one respect she was admirably fitted\\nto introduce a young lady into public, being as fond of going everywhere\\nand seeing everything herself as any young lady could be. Dress was\\nher passion. She had a most harmless delight in being fine; and our\\nheroine's entree into life could not take place till after three or four\\ndays had been spent in learning what was mostly worn, and her chaperone\\nwas provided with a dress of the newest fashion. Catherine too made\\nsome purchases herself, and when all these matters were arranged, the\\nimportant evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms. Her\\nhair was cut and dressed by the best hand, her clothes put on with care,\\nand both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should\\ndo. With such encouragement, Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured\\nthrough the crowd. As for admiration, it was always very welcome when it\\ncame, but she did not depend on it.\\n\\nMrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom\\ntill late. The season was full, the room crowded, and the two ladies\\nsqueezed in as well as they could. As for Mr. Allen, he repaired\\ndirectly to the card-room, and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves.\\nWith more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of\\nher protegee, Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by\\nthe door, as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow; Catherine,\\nhowever, kept close at her side, and linked her arm too firmly within\\nher friend's to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling\\nassembly. But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the\\nroom was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd; it\\nseemed rather to increase as they went on, whereas she had imagined that\\nwhen once fairly within the door, they should easily find seats and be\\nable to watch the dances with perfect convenience. But this was far from\\nbeing the case, and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the\\ntop of the room, their situation was just the same; they saw nothing\\nof the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies. Still they\\nmoved on--something better was yet in view; and by a continued exertion\\nof strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage\\nbehind the highest bench. Here there was something less of crowd than\\nbelow; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the\\ncompany beneath her, and of all the dangers of her late passage through\\nthem. It was a splendid sight, and she began, for the first time that\\nevening, to feel herself at a ball: she longed to dance, but she had\\nnot an acquaintance in the room. Mrs. Allen did all that she could do\\nin such a case by saying very placidly, every now and then, \"I wish you\\ncould dance, my dear--I wish you could get a partner.\" For some time\\nher young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes; but they were\\nrepeated so often, and proved so totally ineffectual, that Catherine\\ngrew tired at last, and would thank her no more.\\n\\nThey were not long able, however, to enjoy the repose of the eminence\\nthey had so laboriously gained. Everybody was shortly in motion for\\ntea, and they must squeeze out like the rest. Catherine began to feel\\nsomething of disappointment--she was tired of being continually pressed\\nagainst by people, the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to\\ninterest, and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she\\ncould not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a\\nsyllable with any of her fellow captives; and when at last arrived in\\nthe tea-room, she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to\\njoin, no acquaintance to claim, no gentleman to assist them. They saw\\nnothing of Mr. Allen; and after looking about them in vain for a more\\neligible situation, were obliged to sit down at the end of a table, at\\nwhich a large party were already placed, without having anything to do\\nthere, or anybody to speak to, except each other.\\n\\nMrs. Allen congratulated herself, as soon as they were seated, on having\\npreserved her gown from injury. \"It would have been very shocking to\\nhave it torn,\" said she, \"would not it? It is such a delicate muslin.\\nFor my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room, I\\nassure you.\"\\n\\n\"How uncomfortable it is,\" whispered Catherine, \"not to have a single\\nacquaintance here!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Allen, with perfect serenity, \"it is very\\nuncomfortable indeed.\"\\n\\n\"What shall we do? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if\\nthey wondered why we came here--we seem forcing ourselves into their\\nparty.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, so we do. That is very disagreeable. I wish we had a large\\nacquaintance here.\"\\n\\n\"I wish we had any--it would be somebody to go to.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, my dear; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly.\\nThe Skinners were here last year--I wish they were here now.\"\\n\\n\"Had not we better go away as it is? Here are no tea-things for us, you\\nsee.\"\\n\\n\"No more there are, indeed. How very provoking! But I think we had\\nbetter sit still, for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd! How is my\\nhead, my dear? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it, I am afraid.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, it looks very nice. But, dear Mrs. Allen, are you sure\\nthere is nobody you know in all this multitude of people? I think you\\nmust know somebody.\"\\n\\n\"I don't, upon my word--I wish I did. I wish I had a large acquaintance\\nhere with all my heart, and then I should get you a partner. I should be\\nso glad to have you dance. There goes a strange-looking woman! What an\\nodd gown she has got on! How old-fashioned it is! Look at the back.\"\\n\\nAfter some time they received an offer of tea from one of their\\nneighbours; it was thankfully accepted, and this introduced a light\\nconversation with the gentleman who offered it, which was the only time\\nthat anybody spoke to them during the evening, till they were discovered\\nand joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over.\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Morland,\" said he, directly, \"I hope you have had an\\nagreeable ball.\"\\n\\n\"Very agreeable indeed,\" she replied, vainly endeavouring to hide a\\ngreat yawn.\\n\\n\"I wish she had been able to dance,\" said his wife; \"I wish we could\\nhave got a partner for her. I have been saying how glad I should be if\\nthe Skinners were here this winter instead of last; or if the Parrys had\\ncome, as they talked of once, she might have danced with George Parry. I\\nam so sorry she has not had a partner!\"\\n\\n\"We shall do better another evening I hope,\" was Mr. Allen's\\nconsolation.\\n\\nThe company began to disperse when the dancing was over--enough to leave\\nspace for the remainder to walk about in some comfort; and now was the\\ntime for a heroine, who had not yet played a very distinguished part\\nin the events of the evening, to be noticed and admired. Every five\\nminutes, by removing some of the crowd, gave greater openings for her\\ncharms. She was now seen by many young men who had not been near her\\nbefore. Not one, however, started with rapturous wonder on beholding\\nher, no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room, nor was she once\\ncalled a divinity by anybody. Yet Catherine was in very good looks, and\\nhad the company only seen her three years before, they would now have\\nthought her exceedingly handsome.\\n\\nShe was looked at, however, and with some admiration; for, in her own\\nhearing, two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl. Such words\\nhad their due effect; she immediately thought the evening pleasanter\\nthan she had found it before--her humble vanity was contented--she\\nfelt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a\\ntrue-quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration\\nof her charms, and went to her chair in good humour with everybody, and\\nperfectly satisfied with her share of public attention.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3\\n\\n\\nEvery morning now brought its regular duties--shops were to be visited;\\nsome new part of the town to be looked at; and the pump-room to be\\nattended, where they paraded up and down for an hour, looking at\\neverybody and speaking to no one. The wish of a numerous acquaintance\\nin Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen, and she repeated it after\\nevery fresh proof, which every morning brought, of her knowing nobody at\\nall.\\n\\nThey made their appearance in the Lower Rooms; and here fortune was more\\nfavourable to our heroine. The master of the ceremonies introduced to\\nher a very gentlemanlike young man as a partner; his name was Tilney.\\nHe seemed to be about four or five and twenty, was rather tall, had a\\npleasing countenance, a very intelligent and lively eye, and, if not\\nquite handsome, was very near it. His address was good, and Catherine\\nfelt herself in high luck. There was little leisure for speaking\\nwhile they danced; but when they were seated at tea, she found him as\\nagreeable as she had already given him credit for being. He talked with\\nfluency and spirit--and there was an archness and pleasantry in his\\nmanner which interested, though it was hardly understood by her. After\\nchatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects\\naround them, he suddenly addressed her with--\"I have hitherto been very\\nremiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a partner here; I have not\\nyet asked you how long you have been in Bath; whether you were ever here\\nbefore; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms, the theatre, and\\nthe concert; and how you like the place altogether. I have been\\nvery negligent--but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these\\nparticulars? If you are I will begin directly.\"\\n\\n\"You need not give yourself that trouble, sir.\"\\n\\n\"No trouble, I assure you, madam.\" Then forming his features into a set\\nsmile, and affectedly softening his voice, he added, with a simpering\\nair, \"Have you been long in Bath, madam?\"\\n\\n\"About a week, sir,\" replied Catherine, trying not to laugh.\\n\\n\"Really!\" with affected astonishment.\\n\\n\"Why should you be surprised, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Why, indeed!\" said he, in his natural tone. \"But some emotion must\\nappear to be raised by your reply, and surprise is more easily assumed,\\nand not less reasonable than any other. Now let us go on. Were you never\\nhere before, madam?\"\\n\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed! Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I was there last Monday.\"\\n\\n\"Have you been to the theatre?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I was at the play on Tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"To the concert?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, on Wednesday.\"\\n\\n\"And are you altogether pleased with Bath?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I like it very well.\"\\n\\n\"Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again.\"\\nCatherine turned away her head, not knowing whether she might venture to\\nlaugh. \"I see what you think of me,\" said he gravely--\"I shall make but\\na poor figure in your journal tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"My journal!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know exactly what you will say: Friday, went to the Lower\\nRooms; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings--plain black\\nshoes--appeared to much advantage; but was strangely harassed by a\\nqueer, half-witted man, who would make me dance with him, and distressed\\nme by his nonsense.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I shall say no such thing.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I tell you what you ought to say?\"\\n\\n\"If you please.\"\\n\\n\"I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced by Mr. King; had\\na great deal of conversation with him--seems a most extraordinary\\ngenius--hope I may know more of him. That, madam, is what I wish you to\\nsay.\"\\n\\n\"But, perhaps, I keep no journal.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you are not sitting in this room, and I am not sitting by\\nyou. These are points in which a doubt is equally possible. Not keep a\\njournal! How are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your\\nlife in Bath without one? How are the civilities and compliments of\\nevery day to be related as they ought to be, unless noted down every\\nevening in a journal? How are your various dresses to be remembered,\\nand the particular state of your complexion, and curl of your hair to be\\ndescribed in all their diversities, without having constant recourse to\\na journal? My dear madam, I am not so ignorant of young ladies' ways as\\nyou wish to believe me; it is this delightful habit of journaling which\\nlargely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies\\nare so generally celebrated. Everybody allows that the talent of writing\\nagreeable letters is peculiarly female. Nature may have done something,\\nbut I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping\\na journal.\"\\n\\n\"I have sometimes thought,\" said Catherine, doubtingly, \"whether ladies\\ndo write so much better letters than gentlemen! That is--I should not\\nthink the superiority was always on our side.\"\\n\\n\"As far as I have had opportunity of judging, it appears to me that the\\nusual style of letter-writing among women is faultless, except in three\\nparticulars.\"\\n\\n\"And what are they?\"\\n\\n\"A general deficiency of subject, a total inattention to stops, and a\\nvery frequent ignorance of grammar.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word! I need not have been afraid of disclaiming the\\ncompliment. You do not think too highly of us in that way.\"\\n\\n\"I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better\\nletters than men, than that they sing better duets, or draw better\\nlandscapes. In every power, of which taste is the foundation, excellence\\nis pretty fairly divided between the sexes.\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted by Mrs. Allen: \"My dear Catherine,\" said she, \"do\\ntake this pin out of my sleeve; I am afraid it has torn a hole already;\\nI shall be quite sorry if it has, for this is a favourite gown, though\\nit cost but nine shillings a yard.\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I should have guessed it, madam,\" said Mr. Tilney,\\nlooking at the muslin.\\n\\n\"Do you understand muslins, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Particularly well; I always buy my own cravats, and am allowed to be an\\nexcellent judge; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a\\ngown. I bought one for her the other day, and it was pronounced to be a\\nprodigious bargain by every lady who saw it. I gave but five shillings a\\nyard for it, and a true Indian muslin.\"\\n\\nMrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius. \"Men commonly take so little\\nnotice of those things,\" said she; \"I can never get Mr. Allen to know\\none of my gowns from another. You must be a great comfort to your\\nsister, sir.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I am, madam.\"\\n\\n\"And pray, sir, what do you think of Miss Morland's gown?\"\\n\\n\"It is very pretty, madam,\" said he, gravely examining it; \"but I do not\\nthink it will wash well; I am afraid it will fray.\"\\n\\n\"How can you,\" said Catherine, laughing, \"be so--\" She had almost said\\n\"strange.\"\\n\\n\"I am quite of your opinion, sir,\" replied Mrs. Allen; \"and so I told\\nMiss Morland when she bought it.\"\\n\\n\"But then you know, madam, muslin always turns to some account or other;\\nMiss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief, or a cap, or\\na cloak. Muslin can never be said to be wasted. I have heard my sister\\nsay so forty times, when she has been extravagant in buying more than\\nshe wanted, or careless in cutting it to pieces.\"\\n\\n\"Bath is a charming place, sir; there are so many good shops here. We\\nare sadly off in the country; not but what we have very good shops in\\nSalisbury, but it is so far to go--eight miles is a long way; Mr. Allen\\nsays it is nine, measured nine; but I am sure it cannot be more than\\neight; and it is such a fag--I come back tired to death. Now, here one\\ncan step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes.\"\\n\\nMr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said; and\\nshe kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced.\\nCatherine feared, as she listened to their discourse, that he indulged\\nhimself a little too much with the foibles of others. \"What are you\\nthinking of so earnestly?\" said he, as they walked back to the ballroom;\\n\"not of your partner, I hope, for, by that shake of the head, your\\nmeditations are not satisfactory.\"\\n\\nCatherine coloured, and said, \"I was not thinking of anything.\"\\n\\n\"That is artful and deep, to be sure; but I had rather be told at once\\nthat you will not tell me.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, I will not.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you; for now we shall soon be acquainted, as I am authorized to\\ntease you on this subject whenever we meet, and nothing in the world\\nadvances intimacy so much.\"\\n\\nThey danced again; and, when the assembly closed, parted, on the\\nlady's side at least, with a strong inclination for continuing the\\nacquaintance. Whether she thought of him so much, while she drank her\\nwarm wine and water, and prepared herself for bed, as to dream of him\\nwhen there, cannot be ascertained; but I hope it was no more than in\\na slight slumber, or a morning doze at most; for if it be true, as a\\ncelebrated writer has maintained, that no young lady can be justified\\nin falling in love before the gentleman's love is declared,* it must be\\nvery improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the\\ngentleman is first known to have dreamt of her. How proper Mr. Tilney\\nmight be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen's\\nhead, but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for\\nhis young charge he was on inquiry satisfied; for he had early in the\\nevening taken pains to know who her partner was, and had been assured\\nof Mr. Tilney's being a clergyman, and of a very respectable family in\\nGloucestershire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\n\\nWith more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump-room the\\nnext day, secure within herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the\\nmorning were over, and ready to meet him with a smile; but no smile\\nwas demanded--Mr. Tilney did not appear. Every creature in Bath,\\nexcept himself, was to be seen in the room at different periods of the\\nfashionable hours; crowds of people were every moment passing in and\\nout, up the steps and down; people whom nobody cared about, and nobody\\nwanted to see; and he only was absent. \"What a delightful place Bath\\nis,\" said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock, after\\nparading the room till they were tired; \"and how pleasant it would be if\\nwe had any acquaintance here.\"\\n\\nThis sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no\\nparticular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now;\\nbut we are told to \"despair of nothing we would attain,\" as \"unwearied\\ndiligence our point would gain\"; and the unwearied diligence with which\\nshe had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its\\njust reward, for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of\\nabout her own age, who was sitting by her, and had been looking at her\\nattentively for several minutes, addressed her with great complaisance\\nin these words: \"I think, madam, I cannot be mistaken; it is a long time\\nsince I had the pleasure of seeing you, but is not your name Allen?\"\\nThis question answered, as it readily was, the stranger pronounced hers\\nto be Thorpe; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of\\na former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since\\ntheir respective marriages, and that many years ago. Their joy on this\\nmeeting was very great, as well it might, since they had been contented\\nto know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years. Compliments\\non good looks now passed; and, after observing how time had slipped away\\nsince they were last together, how little they had thought of meeting in\\nBath, and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend, they proceeded to\\nmake inquiries and give intelligence as to their families, sisters, and\\ncousins, talking both together, far more ready to give than to receive\\ninformation, and each hearing very little of what the other said. Mrs.\\nThorpe, however, had one great advantage as a talker, over Mrs. Allen,\\nin a family of children; and when she expatiated on the talents of her\\nsons, and the beauty of her daughters, when she related their different\\nsituations and views--that John was at Oxford, Edward at Merchant\\nTaylors', and William at sea--and all of them more beloved and respected\\nin their different station than any other three beings ever were, Mrs.\\nAllen had no similar information to give, no similar triumphs to press\\non the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend, and was forced to\\nsit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions, consoling\\nherself, however, with the discovery, which her keen eye soon made, that\\nthe lace on Mrs. Thorpe's pelisse was not half so handsome as that on\\nher own.\\n\\n\"Here come my dear girls,\" cried Mrs. Thorpe, pointing at three\\nsmart-looking females who, arm in arm, were then moving towards her. \"My\\ndear Mrs. Allen, I long to introduce them; they will be so delighted\\nto see you: the tallest is Isabella, my eldest; is not she a fine young\\nwoman? The others are very much admired too, but I believe Isabella is\\nthe handsomest.\"\\n\\nThe Miss Thorpes were introduced; and Miss Morland, who had been for a\\nshort time forgotten, was introduced likewise. The name seemed to strike\\nthem all; and, after speaking to her with great civility, the eldest\\nyoung lady observed aloud to the rest, \"How excessively like her brother\\nMiss Morland is!\"\\n\\n\"The very picture of him indeed!\" cried the mother--and \"I should have\\nknown her anywhere for his sister!\" was repeated by them all, two or\\nthree times over. For a moment Catherine was surprised; but Mrs. Thorpe\\nand her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance\\nwith Mr. James Morland, before she remembered that her eldest brother\\nhad lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college, of\\nthe name of Thorpe; and that he had spent the last week of the Christmas\\nvacation with his family, near London.\\n\\nThe whole being explained, many obliging things were said by the Miss\\nThorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her; of being\\nconsidered as already friends, through the friendship of their brothers,\\netc., which Catherine heard with pleasure, and answered with all the\\npretty expressions she could command; and, as the first proof of amity,\\nshe was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe, and\\ntake a turn with her about the room. Catherine was delighted with this\\nextension of her Bath acquaintance, and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while\\nshe talked to Miss Thorpe. Friendship is certainly the finest balm for\\nthe pangs of disappointed love.\\n\\nTheir conversation turned upon those subjects, of which the free\\ndiscussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy\\nbetween two young ladies: such as dress, balls, flirtations, and\\nquizzes. Miss Thorpe, however, being four years older than Miss Morland,\\nand at least four years better informed, had a very decided advantage in\\ndiscussing such points; she could compare the balls of Bath with those\\nof Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London; could rectify\\nthe opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire;\\ncould discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only\\nsmiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a\\ncrowd. These powers received due admiration from Catherine, to whom they\\nwere entirely new; and the respect which they naturally inspired might\\nhave been too great for familiarity, had not the easy gaiety of Miss\\nThorpe's manners, and her frequent expressions of delight on this\\nacquaintance with her, softened down every feeling of awe, and left\\nnothing but tender affection. Their increasing attachment was not to be\\nsatisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump-room, but required, when\\nthey all quitted it together, that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss\\nMorland to the very door of Mr. Allen's house; and that they should\\nthere part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands, after\\nlearning, to their mutual relief, that they should see each other across\\nthe theatre at night, and say their prayers in the same chapel the next\\nmorning. Catherine then ran directly upstairs, and watched Miss Thorpe's\\nprogress down the street from the drawing-room window; admired the\\ngraceful spirit of her walk, the fashionable air of her figure and\\ndress; and felt grateful, as well she might, for the chance which had\\nprocured her such a friend.\\n\\nMrs. Thorpe was a widow, and not a very rich one; she was a\\ngood-humoured, well-meaning woman, and a very indulgent mother. Her\\neldest daughter had great personal beauty, and the younger ones, by\\npretending to be as handsome as their sister, imitating her air, and\\ndressing in the same style, did very well.\\n\\nThis brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity\\nof a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself, of her past\\nadventures and sufferings, which might otherwise be expected to occupy\\nthe three or four following chapters; in which the worthlessness of\\nlords and attorneys might be set forth, and conversations, which had\\npassed twenty years before, be minutely repeated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\n\\nCatherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening, in\\nreturning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe, though they certainly\\nclaimed much of her leisure, as to forget to look with an inquiring eye\\nfor Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach; but she looked in\\nvain. Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump-room. She hoped\\nto be more fortunate the next day; and when her wishes for fine weather\\nwere answered by seeing a beautiful morning, she hardly felt a doubt of\\nit; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants,\\nand all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell\\ntheir acquaintance what a charming day it is.\\n\\nAs soon as divine service was over, the Thorpes and Allens eagerly\\njoined each other; and after staying long enough in the pump-room to\\ndiscover that the crowd was insupportable, and that there was not\\na genteel face to be seen, which everybody discovers every Sunday\\nthroughout the season, they hastened away to the Crescent, to breathe\\nthe fresh air of better company. Here Catherine and Isabella, arm\\nin arm, again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved\\nconversation; they talked much, and with much enjoyment; but again\\nwas Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner. He was\\nnowhere to be met with; every search for him was equally unsuccessful,\\nin morning lounges or evening assemblies; neither at the Upper nor Lower\\nRooms, at dressed or undressed balls, was he perceivable; nor among the\\nwalkers, the horsemen, or the curricle-drivers of the morning. His name\\nwas not in the pump-room book, and curiosity could do no more. He must\\nbe gone from Bath. Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so\\nshort! This sort of mysteriousness, which is always so becoming in a\\nhero, threw a fresh grace in Catherine's imagination around his person\\nand manners, and increased her anxiety to know more of him. From the\\nThorpes she could learn nothing, for they had been only two days in Bath\\nbefore they met with Mrs. Allen. It was a subject, however, in which\\nshe often indulged with her fair friend, from whom she received every\\npossible encouragement to continue to think of him; and his impression\\non her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken. Isabella was very\\nsure that he must be a charming young man, and was equally sure that he\\nmust have been delighted with her dear Catherine, and would therefore\\nshortly return. She liked him the better for being a clergyman, \"for she\\nmust confess herself very partial to the profession\"; and something like\\na sigh escaped her as she said it. Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not\\ndemanding the cause of that gentle emotion--but she was not experienced\\nenough in the finesse of love, or the duties of friendship, to know when\\ndelicate raillery was properly called for, or when a confidence should\\nbe forced.\\n\\nMrs. Allen was now quite happy--quite satisfied with Bath. She had found\\nsome acquaintance, had been so lucky too as to find in them the family\\nof a most worthy old friend; and, as the completion of good fortune, had\\nfound these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself. Her\\ndaily expressions were no longer, \"I wish we had some acquaintance in\\nBath!\" They were changed into, \"How glad I am we have met with Mrs.\\nThorpe!\" and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two\\nfamilies, as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be; never\\nsatisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of\\nMrs. Thorpe, in what they called conversation, but in which there was\\nscarcely ever any exchange of opinion, and not often any resemblance of\\nsubject, for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children, and Mrs. Allen\\nof her gowns.\\n\\nThe progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick\\nas its beginning had been warm, and they passed so rapidly through every\\ngradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof\\nof it to be given to their friends or themselves. They called each other\\nby their Christian name, were always arm in arm when they walked, pinned\\nup each other's train for the dance, and were not to be divided in the\\nset; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments, they\\nwere still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt, and shut\\nthemselves up, to read novels together. Yes, novels; for I will not\\nadopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers,\\nof degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the\\nnumber of which they are themselves adding--joining with their greatest\\nenemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely\\never permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she\\naccidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages\\nwith disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the\\nheroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard? I\\ncannot approve of it. Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such\\neffusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in\\nthreadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans. Let us\\nnot desert one another; we are an injured body. Although our productions\\nhave afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any\\nother literary corporation in the world, no species of composition has\\nbeen so much decried. From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our foes\\nare almost as many as our readers. And while the abilities of the\\nnine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man who\\ncollects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and\\nPrior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne,\\nare eulogized by a thousand pens--there seems almost a general wish of\\ndecrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and\\nof slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste to\\nrecommend them. \"I am no novel-reader--I seldom look into novels--Do not\\nimagine that I often read novels--It is really very well for a novel.\"\\nSuch is the common cant. \"And what are you reading, Miss--?\" \"Oh! It is\\nonly a novel!\" replies the young lady, while she lays down her book\\nwith affected indifference, or momentary shame. \"It is only Cecilia, or\\nCamilla, or Belinda\"; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest\\npowers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge\\nof human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the\\nliveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the\\nbest-chosen language. Now, had the same young lady been engaged with a\\nvolume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly would she\\nhave produced the book, and told its name; though the chances must be\\nagainst her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication,\\nof which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of\\ntaste: the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement\\nof improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and topics of\\nconversation which no longer concern anyone living; and their language,\\ntoo, frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age\\nthat could endure it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\n\\nThe following conversation, which took place between the two friends in\\nthe pump-room one morning, after an acquaintance of eight or nine\\ndays, is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment, and of the\\ndelicacy, discretion, originality of thought, and literary taste which\\nmarked the reasonableness of that attachment.\\n\\nThey met by appointment; and as Isabella had arrived nearly five\\nminutes before her friend, her first address naturally was, \"My dearest\\ncreature, what can have made you so late? I have been waiting for you at\\nleast this age!\"\\n\\n\"Have you, indeed! I am very sorry for it; but really I thought I was in\\nvery good time. It is but just one. I hope you have not been here long?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! These ten ages at least. I am sure I have been here this half hour.\\nBut now, let us go and sit down at the other end of the room, and enjoy\\nourselves. I have an hundred things to say to you. In the first place,\\nI was so afraid it would rain this morning, just as I wanted to set off;\\nit looked very showery, and that would have thrown me into agonies! Do\\nyou know, I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine, in a shop window in\\nMilsom Street just now--very like yours, only with coquelicot ribbons\\ninstead of green; I quite longed for it. But, my dearest Catherine, what\\nhave you been doing with yourself all this morning? Have you gone on\\nwith Udolpho?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have been reading it ever since I woke; and I am got to the\\nblack veil.\"\\n\\n\"Are you, indeed? How delightful! Oh! I would not tell you what is\\nbehind the black veil for the world! Are not you wild to know?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Yes, quite; what can it be? But do not tell me--I would not be\\ntold upon any account. I know it must be a skeleton, I am sure it is\\nLaurentina's skeleton. Oh! I am delighted with the book! I should like\\nto spend my whole life in reading it. I assure you, if it had not been\\nto meet you, I would not have come away from it for all the world.\"\\n\\n\"Dear creature! How much I am obliged to you; and when you have finished\\nUdolpho, we will read the Italian together; and I have made out a list\\nof ten or twelve more of the same kind for you.\"\\n\\n\"Have you, indeed! How glad I am! What are they all?\"\\n\\n\"I will read you their names directly; here they are, in my pocketbook.\\nCastle of Wolfenbach, Clermont, Mysterious Warnings, Necromancer of the\\nBlack Forest, Midnight Bell, Orphan of the Rhine, and Horrid Mysteries.\\nThose will last us some time.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, pretty well; but are they all horrid, are you sure they are all\\nhorrid?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, quite sure; for a particular friend of mine, a Miss Andrews, a\\nsweet girl, one of the sweetest creatures in the world, has read every\\none of them. I wish you knew Miss Andrews, you would be delighted with\\nher. She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive. I think\\nher as beautiful as an angel, and I am so vexed with the men for not\\nadmiring her! I scold them all amazingly about it.\"\\n\\n\"Scold them! Do you scold them for not admiring her?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that I do. There is nothing I would not do for those who are\\nreally my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves; it is\\nnot my nature. My attachments are always excessively strong. I told\\nCaptain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to\\ntease me all night, I would not dance with him, unless he would allow\\nMiss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel. The men think us incapable\\nof real friendship, you know, and I am determined to show them the\\ndifference. Now, if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you, I\\nshould fire up in a moment: but that is not at all likely, for you are\\njust the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear!\" cried Catherine, colouring. \"How can you say so?\"\\n\\n\"I know you very well; you have so much animation, which is exactly\\nwhat Miss Andrews wants, for I must confess there is something amazingly\\ninsipid about her. Oh! I must tell you, that just after we parted\\nyesterday, I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly--I am sure he\\nis in love with you.\" Catherine coloured, and disclaimed again. Isabella\\nlaughed. \"It is very true, upon my honour, but I see how it is; you are\\nindifferent to everybody's admiration, except that of one gentleman,\\nwho shall be nameless. Nay, I cannot blame you\"--speaking more\\nseriously--\"your feelings are easily understood. Where the heart is\\nreally attached, I know very well how little one can be pleased with the\\nattention of anybody else. Everything is so insipid, so uninteresting,\\nthat does not relate to the beloved object! I can perfectly comprehend\\nyour feelings.\"\\n\\n\"But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr.\\nTilney, for perhaps I may never see him again.\"\\n\\n\"Not see him again! My dearest creature, do not talk of it. I am sure\\nyou would be miserable if you thought so!\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I should not. I do not pretend to say that I was not very\\nmuch pleased with him; but while I have Udolpho to read, I feel as if\\nnobody could make me miserable. Oh! The dreadful black veil! My dear\\nIsabella, I am sure there must be Laurentina's skeleton behind it.\"\\n\\n\"It is so odd to me, that you should never have read Udolpho before; but\\nI suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels.\"\\n\\n\"No, she does not. She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself;\\nbut new books do not fall in our way.\"\\n\\n\"Sir Charles Grandison! That is an amazing horrid book, is it not? I\\nremember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume.\"\\n\\n\"It is not like Udolpho at all; but yet I think it is very\\nentertaining.\"\\n\\n\"Do you indeed! You surprise me; I thought it had not been readable.\\nBut, my dearest Catherine, have you settled what to wear on your head\\ntonight? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you.\\nThe men take notice of that sometimes, you know.\"\\n\\n\"But it does not signify if they do,\" said Catherine, very innocently.\\n\\n\"Signify! Oh, heavens! I make it a rule never to mind what they say.\\nThey are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with\\nspirit, and make them keep their distance.\"\\n\\n\"Are they? Well, I never observed that. They always behave very well to\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! They give themselves such airs. They are the most conceited\\ncreatures in the world, and think themselves of so much importance!\\nBy the by, though I have thought of it a hundred times, I have always\\nforgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man. Do you\\nlike them best dark or fair?\"\\n\\n\"I hardly know. I never much thought about it. Something between both, I\\nthink. Brown--not fair, and--and not very dark.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, Catherine. That is exactly he. I have not forgot your\\ndescription of Mr. Tilney--'a brown skin, with dark eyes, and rather\\ndark hair.' Well, my taste is different. I prefer light eyes, and as to\\ncomplexion--do you know--I like a sallow better than any other. You must\\nnot betray me, if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance\\nanswering that description.\"\\n\\n\"Betray you! What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Nay, do not distress me. I believe I have said too much. Let us drop\\nthe subject.\"\\n\\nCatherine, in some amazement, complied, and after remaining a few\\nmoments silent, was on the point of reverting to what interested her\\nat that time rather more than anything else in the world, Laurentina's\\nskeleton, when her friend prevented her, by saying, \"For heaven's sake!\\nLet us move away from this end of the room. Do you know, there are two\\nodious young men who have been staring at me this half hour. They really\\nput me quite out of countenance. Let us go and look at the arrivals.\\nThey will hardly follow us there.\"\\n\\nAway they walked to the book; and while Isabella examined the names, it\\nwas Catherine's employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming\\nyoung men.\\n\\n\"They are not coming this way, are they? I hope they are not so\\nimpertinent as to follow us. Pray let me know if they are coming. I am\\ndetermined I will not look up.\"\\n\\nIn a few moments Catherine, with unaffected pleasure, assured her\\nthat she need not be longer uneasy, as the gentlemen had just left the\\npump-room.\\n\\n\"And which way are they gone?\" said Isabella, turning hastily round.\\n\"One was a very good-looking young man.\"\\n\\n\"They went towards the church-yard.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them! And now, what say you\\nto going to Edgar's Buildings with me, and looking at my new hat? You\\nsaid you should like to see it.\"\\n\\nCatherine readily agreed. \"Only,\" she added, \"perhaps we may overtake\\nthe two young men.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Never mind that. If we make haste, we shall pass by them presently,\\nand I am dying to show you my hat.\"\\n\\n\"But if we only wait a few minutes, there will be no danger of our\\nseeing them at all.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not pay them any such compliment, I assure you. I have no\\nnotion of treating men with such respect. That is the way to spoil\\nthem.\"\\n\\nCatherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning; and therefore,\\nto show the independence of Miss Thorpe, and her resolution of humbling\\nthe sex, they set off immediately as fast as they could walk, in pursuit\\nof the two young men.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\n\\nHalf a minute conducted them through the pump-yard to the archway,\\nopposite Union Passage; but here they were stopped. Everybody acquainted\\nwith Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap Street at\\nthis point; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature, so\\nunfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads, and the\\nprincipal inn of the city, that a day never passes in which parties of\\nladies, however important their business, whether in quest of pastry,\\nmillinery, or even (as in the present case) of young men, are not\\ndetained on one side or other by carriages, horsemen, or carts. This\\nevil had been felt and lamented, at least three times a day, by Isabella\\nsince her residence in Bath; and she was now fated to feel and lament it\\nonce more, for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage,\\nand within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the\\ncrowds, and threading the gutters of that interesting alley, they\\nwere prevented crossing by the approach of a gig, driven along on bad\\npavement by a most knowing-looking coachman with all the vehemence that\\ncould most fitly endanger the lives of himself, his companion, and his\\nhorse.\\n\\n\"Oh, these odious gigs!\" said Isabella, looking up. \"How I detest them.\"\\nBut this detestation, though so just, was of short duration, for she\\nlooked again and exclaimed, \"Delightful! Mr. Morland and my brother!\"\\n\\n\"Good heaven! 'Tis James!\" was uttered at the same moment by Catherine;\\nand, on catching the young men's eyes, the horse was immediately checked\\nwith a violence which almost threw him on his haunches, and the servant\\nhaving now scampered up, the gentlemen jumped out, and the equipage was\\ndelivered to his care.\\n\\nCatherine, by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected, received her\\nbrother with the liveliest pleasure; and he, being of a very amiable\\ndisposition, and sincerely attached to her, gave every proof on his\\nside of equal satisfaction, which he could have leisure to do, while the\\nbright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice;\\nand to her his devoirs were speedily paid, with a mixture of joy and\\nembarrassment which might have informed Catherine, had she been more\\nexpert in the development of other people's feelings, and less simply\\nengrossed by her own, that her brother thought her friend quite as\\npretty as she could do herself.\\n\\nJohn Thorpe, who in the meantime had been giving orders about the\\nhorses, soon joined them, and from him she directly received the amends\\nwhich were her due; for while he slightly and carelessly touched the\\nhand of Isabella, on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short\\nbow. He was a stout young man of middling height, who, with a plain face\\nand ungraceful form, seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he wore\\nthe dress of a groom, and too much like a gentleman unless he were easy\\nwhere he ought to be civil, and impudent where he might be allowed to be\\neasy. He took out his watch: \"How long do you think we have been running\\nit from Tetbury, Miss Morland?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know the distance.\" Her brother told her that it was\\ntwenty-three miles.\\n\\n\"Three and twenty!\" cried Thorpe. \"Five and twenty if it is an inch.\"\\nMorland remonstrated, pleaded the authority of road-books, innkeepers,\\nand milestones; but his friend disregarded them all; he had a surer test\\nof distance. \"I know it must be five and twenty,\" said he, \"by the time\\nwe have been doing it. It is now half after one; we drove out of the\\ninn-yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven; and I defy any man\\nin England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness;\\nthat makes it exactly twenty-five.\"\\n\\n\"You have lost an hour,\" said Morland; \"it was only ten o'clock when we\\ncame from Tetbury.\"\\n\\n\"Ten o'clock! It was eleven, upon my soul! I counted every stroke. This\\nbrother of yours would persuade me out of my senses, Miss Morland; do\\nbut look at my horse; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in\\nyour life?\" (The servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving\\noff.) \"Such true blood! Three hours and and a half indeed coming only\\nthree and twenty miles! Look at that creature, and suppose it possible\\nif you can.\"\\n\\n\"He does look very hot, to be sure.\"\\n\\n\"Hot! He had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church; but look\\nat his forehand; look at his loins; only see how he moves; that horse\\ncannot go less than ten miles an hour: tie his legs and he will get on.\\nWhat do you think of my gig, Miss Morland? A neat one, is not it?\\nWell hung; town-built; I have not had it a month. It was built for a\\nChristchurch man, a friend of mine, a very good sort of fellow; he ran\\nit a few weeks, till, I believe, it was convenient to have done with it.\\nI happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind,\\nthough I had pretty well determined on a curricle too; but I chanced to\\nmeet him on Magdalen Bridge, as he was driving into Oxford, last term:\\n'Ah! Thorpe,' said he, 'do you happen to want such a little thing as\\nthis? It is a capital one of the kind, but I am cursed tired of it.'\\n'Oh! D--,' said I; 'I am your man; what do you ask?' And how much do you\\nthink he did, Miss Morland?\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I cannot guess at all.\"\\n\\n\"Curricle-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case, splashing-board,\\nlamps, silver moulding, all you see complete; the iron-work as good\\nas new, or better. He asked fifty guineas; I closed with him directly,\\nthrew down the money, and the carriage was mine.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure,\" said Catherine, \"I know so little of such things that I\\ncannot judge whether it was cheap or dear.\"\\n\\n\"Neither one nor t'other; I might have got it for less, I dare say; but\\nI hate haggling, and poor Freeman wanted cash.\"\\n\\n\"That was very good-natured of you,\" said Catherine, quite pleased.\\n\\n\"Oh! D---- it, when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend,\\nI hate to be pitiful.\"\\n\\nAn inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young\\nladies; and, on finding whither they were going, it was decided that\\nthe gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar's Buildings, and pay their\\nrespects to Mrs. Thorpe. James and Isabella led the way; and so\\nwell satisfied was the latter with her lot, so contentedly was she\\nendeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double\\nrecommendation of being her brother's friend, and her friend's brother,\\nso pure and uncoquettish were her feelings, that, though they overtook\\nand passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street, she was so far\\nfrom seeking to attract their notice, that she looked back at them only\\nthree times.\\n\\nJohn Thorpe kept of course with Catherine, and, after a few minutes'\\nsilence, renewed the conversation about his gig. \"You will find,\\nhowever, Miss Morland, it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some\\npeople, for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day;\\nJackson, of Oriel, bid me sixty at once; Morland was with me at the\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Morland, who overheard this; \"but you forget that your horse\\nwas included.\"\\n\\n\"My horse! Oh, d---- it! I would not sell my horse for a hundred. Are\\nyou fond of an open carriage, Miss Morland?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one; but I am\\nparticularly fond of it.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of it; I will drive you out in mine every day.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Catherine, in some distress, from a doubt of the\\npropriety of accepting such an offer.\\n\\n\"I will drive you up Lansdown Hill tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you; but will not your horse want rest?\"\\n\\n\"Rest! He has only come three and twenty miles today; all nonsense;\\nnothing ruins horses so much as rest; nothing knocks them up so soon.\\nNo, no; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day\\nwhile I am here.\"\\n\\n\"Shall you indeed!\" said Catherine very seriously. \"That will be forty\\nmiles a day.\"\\n\\n\"Forty! Aye, fifty, for what I care. Well, I will drive you up Lansdown\\ntomorrow; mind, I am engaged.\"\\n\\n\"How delightful that will be!\" cried Isabella, turning round. \"My\\ndearest Catherine, I quite envy you; but I am afraid, brother, you will\\nnot have room for a third.\"\\n\\n\"A third indeed! No, no; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters\\nabout; that would be a good joke, faith! Morland must take care of you.\"\\n\\nThis brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two; but\\nCatherine heard neither the particulars nor the result. Her companion's\\ndiscourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than\\na short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every\\nwoman they met; and Catherine, after listening and agreeing as long as\\nshe could, with all the civility and deference of the youthful female\\nmind, fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that\\nof a self-assured man, especially where the beauty of her own sex is\\nconcerned, ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which\\nhad been long uppermost in her thoughts; it was, \"Have you ever read\\nUdolpho, Mr. Thorpe?\"\\n\\n\"Udolpho! Oh, Lord! Not I; I never read novels; I have something else to\\ndo.\"\\n\\nCatherine, humbled and ashamed, was going to apologize for her question,\\nbut he prevented her by saying, \"Novels are all so full of nonsense\\nand stuff; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since\\nTom Jones, except The Monk; I read that t'other day; but as for all the\\nothers, they are the stupidest things in creation.\"\\n\\n\"I think you must like Udolpho, if you were to read it; it is so very\\ninteresting.\"\\n\\n\"Not I, faith! No, if I read any, it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe's; her\\nnovels are amusing enough; they are worth reading; some fun and nature\\nin them.\"\\n\\n\"Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe,\" said Catherine, with some\\nhesitation, from the fear of mortifying him.\\n\\n\"No sure; was it? Aye, I remember, so it was; I was thinking of that\\nother stupid book, written by that woman they make such a fuss about,\\nshe who married the French emigrant.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose you mean Camilla?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that's the book; such unnatural stuff! An old man playing at\\nsee-saw, I took up the first volume once and looked it over, but I soon\\nfound it would not do; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be\\nbefore I saw it: as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant, I was\\nsure I should never be able to get through it.\"\\n\\n\"I have never read it.\"\\n\\n\"You had no loss, I assure you; it is the horridest nonsense you can\\nimagine; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man's playing at\\nsee-saw and learning Latin; upon my soul there is not.\"\\n\\nThis critique, the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor\\nCatherine, brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe's lodgings, and the\\nfeelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way\\nto the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son, as they met Mrs.\\nThorpe, who had descried them from above, in the passage. \"Ah, Mother!\\nHow do you do?\" said he, giving her a hearty shake of the hand. \"Where\\ndid you get that quiz of a hat? It makes you look like an old witch.\\nHere is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you, so you must look\\nout for a couple of good beds somewhere near.\" And this address seemed\\nto satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother's heart, for she\\nreceived him with the most delighted and exulting affection. On his\\ntwo younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternal\\ntenderness, for he asked each of them how they did, and observed that\\nthey both looked very ugly.\\n\\nThese manners did not please Catherine; but he was James's friend\\nand Isabella's brother; and her judgment was further bought off by\\nIsabella's assuring her, when they withdrew to see the new hat, that\\nJohn thought her the most charming girl in the world, and by John's\\nengaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening. Had she\\nbeen older or vainer, such attacks might have done little; but, where\\nyouth and diffidence are united, it requires uncommon steadiness of\\nreason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl\\nin the world, and of being so very early engaged as a partner; and the\\nconsequence was that, when the two Morlands, after sitting an hour with\\nthe Thorpes, set off to walk together to Mr. Allen's, and James, as\\nthe door was closed on them, said, \"Well, Catherine, how do you like my\\nfriend Thorpe?\" instead of answering, as she probably would have done,\\nhad there been no friendship and no flattery in the case, \"I do not like\\nhim at all,\" she directly replied, \"I like him very much; he seems very\\nagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"He is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived; a little of a rattle; but\\nthat will recommend him to your sex, I believe: and how do you like the\\nrest of the family?\"\\n\\n\"Very, very much indeed: Isabella particularly.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad to hear you say so; she is just the kind of young woman\\nI could wish to see you attached to; she has so much good sense, and is\\nso thoroughly unaffected and amiable; I always wanted you to know her;\\nand she seems very fond of you. She said the highest things in your\\npraise that could possibly be; and the praise of such a girl as Miss\\nThorpe even you, Catherine,\" taking her hand with affection, \"may be\\nproud of.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I am,\" she replied; \"I love her exceedingly, and am delighted\\nto find that you like her too. You hardly mentioned anything of her when\\nyou wrote to me after your visit there.\"\\n\\n\"Because I thought I should soon see you myself. I hope you will be a\\ngreat deal together while you are in Bath. She is a most amiable girl;\\nsuch a superior understanding! How fond all the family are of her; she\\nis evidently the general favourite; and how much she must be admired in\\nsuch a place as this--is not she?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very much indeed, I fancy; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl\\nin Bath.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say he does; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of\\nbeauty than Mr. Allen. I need not ask you whether you are happy here, my\\ndear Catherine; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe, it\\nwould be impossible for you to be otherwise; and the Allens, I am sure,\\nare very kind to you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and now you are come it\\nwill be more delightful than ever; how good it is of you to come so far\\non purpose to see me.\"\\n\\nJames accepted this tribute of gratitude, and qualified his conscience\\nfor accepting it too, by saying with perfect sincerity, \"Indeed,\\nCatherine, I love you dearly.\"\\n\\nInquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters, the\\nsituation of some, the growth of the rest, and other family matters now\\npassed between them, and continued, with only one small digression\\non James's part, in praise of Miss Thorpe, till they reached Pulteney\\nStreet, where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen,\\ninvited by the former to dine with them, and summoned by the latter\\nto guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet.\\nA pre-engagement in Edgar's Buildings prevented his accepting the\\ninvitation of one friend, and obliged him to hurry away as soon as he\\nhad satisfied the demands of the other. The time of the two parties\\nuniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted, Catherine was then\\nleft to the luxury of a raised, restless, and frightened imagination\\nover the pages of Udolpho, lost from all worldly concerns of dressing\\nand dinner, incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen's fears on the delay of an\\nexpected dressmaker, and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even\\non the reflection of her own felicity, in being already engaged for the\\nevening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 8\\n\\n\\nIn spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker, however, the party from Pulteney\\nStreet reached the Upper Rooms in very good time. The Thorpes and James\\nMorland were there only two minutes before them; and Isabella having\\ngone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the most\\nsmiling and affectionate haste, of admiring the set of her gown, and\\nenvying the curl of her hair, they followed their chaperones, arm in\\narm, into the ballroom, whispering to each other whenever a thought\\noccurred, and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand\\nor a smile of affection.\\n\\nThe dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated; and\\nJames, who had been engaged quite as long as his sister, was very\\nimportunate with Isabella to stand up; but John was gone into the\\ncard-room to speak to a friend, and nothing, she declared, should induce\\nher to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too. \"I\\nassure you,\" said she, \"I would not stand up without your dear sister\\nfor all the world; for if I did we should certainly be separated the\\nwhole evening.\" Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude, and\\nthey continued as they were for three minutes longer, when Isabella, who\\nhad been talking to James on the other side of her, turned again to his\\nsister and whispered, \"My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you,\\nyour brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you will not\\nmind my going away, and I dare say John will be back in a moment,\\nand then you may easily find me out.\" Catherine, though a little\\ndisappointed, had too much good nature to make any opposition, and the\\nothers rising up, Isabella had only time to press her friend's hand and\\nsay, \"Good-bye, my dear love,\" before they hurried off. The younger\\nMiss Thorpes being also dancing, Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs.\\nThorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom she now remained. She could not help\\nbeing vexed at the non-appearance of Mr. Thorpe, for she not only longed\\nto be dancing, but was likewise aware that, as the real dignity of her\\nsituation could not be known, she was sharing with the scores of other\\nyoung ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner.\\nTo be disgraced in the eye of the world, to wear the appearance of\\ninfamy while her heart is all purity, her actions all innocence, and the\\nmisconduct of another the true source of her debasement, is one of those\\ncircumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine's life, and her\\nfortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character. Catherine\\nhad fortitude too; she suffered, but no murmur passed her lips.\\n\\nFrom this state of humiliation, she was roused, at the end of ten\\nminutes, to a pleasanter feeling, by seeing, not Mr. Thorpe, but Mr.\\nTilney, within three yards of the place where they sat; he seemed to be\\nmoving that way, but he did not see her, and therefore the smile and the\\nblush, which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine, passed away\\nwithout sullying her heroic importance. He looked as handsome and as\\nlively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable and\\npleasing-looking young woman, who leant on his arm, and whom Catherine\\nimmediately guessed to be his sister; thus unthinkingly throwing away\\na fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever, by being\\nmarried already. But guided only by what was simple and probable, it\\nhad never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he had not\\nbehaved, he had not talked, like the married men to whom she had been\\nused; he had never mentioned a wife, and he had acknowledged a sister.\\nFrom these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister's\\nnow being by his side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlike\\npaleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen's bosom, Catherine sat\\nerect, in the perfect use of her senses, and with cheeks only a little\\nredder than usual.\\n\\nMr. Tilney and his companion, who continued, though slowly, to approach,\\nwere immediately preceded by a lady, an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe; and\\nthis lady stopping to speak to her, they, as belonging to her, stopped\\nlikewise, and Catherine, catching Mr. Tilney's eye, instantly received\\nfrom him the smiling tribute of recognition. She returned it with\\npleasure, and then advancing still nearer, he spoke both to her and Mrs.\\nAllen, by whom he was very civilly acknowledged. \"I am very happy to see\\nyou again, sir, indeed; I was afraid you had left Bath.\" He thanked her\\nfor her fears, and said that he had quitted it for a week, on the very\\nmorning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again, for it\\nis just the place for young people--and indeed for everybody else too.\\nI tell Mr. Allen, when he talks of being sick of it, that I am sure he\\nshould not complain, for it is so very agreeable a place, that it is\\nmuch better to be here than at home at this dull time of year. I tell\\nhim he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health.\"\\n\\n\"And I hope, madam, that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place,\\nfrom finding it of service to him.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir. I have no doubt that he will. A neighbour of ours,\\nDr. Skinner, was here for his health last winter, and came away quite\\nstout.\"\\n\\n\"That circumstance must give great encouragement.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir--and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months; so I\\ntell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen,\\nthat she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney\\nwith seats, as they had agreed to join their party. This was accordingly\\ndone, Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them; and after a\\nfew minutes' consideration, he asked Catherine to dance with him. This\\ncompliment, delightful as it was, produced severe mortification to the\\nlady; and in giving her denial, she expressed her sorrow on the occasion\\nso very much as if she really felt it that had Thorpe, who joined her\\njust afterwards, been half a minute earlier, he might have thought her\\nsufferings rather too acute. The very easy manner in which he then told\\nher that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more\\nto her lot; nor did the particulars which he entered into while they\\nwere standing up, of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just\\nleft, and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them, interest her\\nso much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the\\nroom where she had left Mr. Tilney. Of her dear Isabella, to whom she\\nparticularly longed to point out that gentleman, she could see nothing.\\nThey were in different sets. She was separated from all her party, and\\naway from all her acquaintance; one mortification succeeded another,\\nand from the whole she deduced this useful lesson, that to go previously\\nengaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or\\nenjoyment of a young lady. From such a moralizing strain as this, she\\nwas suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder, and turning round,\\nperceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her, attended by Miss Tilney and\\na gentleman. \"I beg your pardon, Miss Morland,\" said she, \"for this\\nliberty--but I cannot anyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Mrs. Thorpe said\\nshe was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this\\nyoung lady by you.\" Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature\\nin the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine. The young ladies\\nwere introduced to each other, Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of\\nsuch goodness, Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind\\nmaking light of the obligation; and Mrs. Hughes, satisfied with having\\nso respectably settled her young charge, returned to her party.\\n\\nMiss Tilney had a good figure, a pretty face, and a very agreeable\\ncountenance; and her air, though it had not all the decided pretension,\\nthe resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe's, had more real elegance. Her\\nmanners showed good sense and good breeding; they were neither shy nor\\naffectedly open; and she seemed capable of being young, attractive, and\\nat a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her,\\nand without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable\\nvexation on every little trifling occurrence. Catherine, interested at\\nonce by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirous\\nof being acquainted with her, and readily talked therefore whenever she\\ncould think of anything to say, and had courage and leisure for saying\\nit. But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy, by\\nthe frequent want of one or more of these requisites, prevented their\\ndoing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance, by\\ninforming themselves how well the other liked Bath, how much she admired\\nits buildings and surrounding country, whether she drew, or played, or\\nsang, and whether she was fond of riding on horseback.\\n\\nThe two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm\\ngently seized by her faithful Isabella, who in great spirits exclaimed,\\n\"At last I have got you. My dearest creature, I have been looking for\\nyou this hour. What could induce you to come into this set, when you\\nknew I was in the other? I have been quite wretched without you.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Isabella, how was it possible for me to get at you? I could not\\neven see where you were.\"\\n\\n\"So I told your brother all the time--but he would not believe me. Do go\\nand see for her, Mr. Morland, said I--but all in vain--he would not stir\\nan inch. Was not it so, Mr. Morland? But you men are all so immoderately\\nlazy! I have been scolding him to such a degree, my dear Catherine, you\\nwould be quite amazed. You know I never stand upon ceremony with such\\npeople.\"\\n\\n\"Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head,\" whispered\\nCatherine, detaching her friend from James. \"It is Mr. Tilney's sister.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Heavens! You don't say so! Let me look at her this moment. What a\\ndelightful girl! I never saw anything half so beautiful! But where is\\nher all-conquering brother? Is he in the room? Point him out to me this\\ninstant, if he is. I die to see him. Mr. Morland, you are not to listen.\\nWe are not talking about you.\"\\n\\n\"But what is all this whispering about? What is going on?\"\\n\\n\"There now, I knew how it would be. You men have such restless\\ncuriosity! Talk of the curiosity of women, indeed! 'Tis nothing. But be\\nsatisfied, for you are not to know anything at all of the matter.\"\\n\\n\"And is that likely to satisfy me, do you think?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I declare I never knew anything like you. What can it signify to\\nyou, what we are talking of. Perhaps we are talking about you; therefore\\nI would advise you not to listen, or you may happen to hear something\\nnot very agreeable.\"\\n\\nIn this commonplace chatter, which lasted some time, the original\\nsubject seemed entirely forgotten; and though Catherine was very well\\npleased to have it dropped for a while, she could not avoid a little\\nsuspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella's impatient desire to\\nsee Mr. Tilney. When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance, James would\\nhave led his fair partner away, but she resisted. \"I tell you, Mr.\\nMorland,\" she cried, \"I would not do such a thing for all the world.\\nHow can you be so teasing; only conceive, my dear Catherine, what your\\nbrother wants me to do. He wants me to dance with him again, though\\nI tell him that it is a most improper thing, and entirely against the\\nrules. It would make us the talk of the place, if we were not to change\\npartners.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my honour,\" said James, \"in these public assemblies, it is as\\noften done as not.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense, how can you say so? But when you men have a point to carry,\\nyou never stick at anything. My sweet Catherine, do support me; persuade\\nyour brother how impossible it is. Tell him that it would quite shock\\nyou to see me do such a thing; now would not it?\"\\n\\n\"No, not at all; but if you think it wrong, you had much better change.\"\\n\\n\"There,\" cried Isabella, \"you hear what your sister says, and yet you\\nwill not mind her. Well, remember that it is not my fault, if we set all\\nthe old ladies in Bath in a bustle. Come along, my dearest Catherine,\\nfor heaven's sake, and stand by me.\" And off they went, to regain\\ntheir former place. John Thorpe, in the meanwhile, had walked away; and\\nCatherine, ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of repeating\\nthe agreeable request which had already flattered her once, made her\\nway to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could, in the hope\\nof finding him still with them--a hope which, when it proved to be\\nfruitless, she felt to have been highly unreasonable. \"Well, my dear,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Thorpe, impatient for praise of her son, \"I hope you have had\\nan agreeable partner.\"\\n\\n\"Very agreeable, madam.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of it. John has charming spirits, has not he?\"\\n\\n\"Did you meet Mr. Tilney, my dear?\" said Mrs. Allen.\\n\\n\"No, where is he?\"\\n\\n\"He was with us just now, and said he was so tired of lounging about,\\nthat he was resolved to go and dance; so I thought perhaps he would ask\\nyou, if he met with you.\"\\n\\n\"Where can he be?\" said Catherine, looking round; but she had not looked\\nround long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance.\\n\\n\"Ah! He has got a partner; I wish he had asked you,\" said Mrs. Allen;\\nand after a short silence, she added, \"he is a very agreeable young\\nman.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed he is, Mrs. Allen,\" said Mrs. Thorpe, smiling complacently; \"I\\nmust say it, though I am his mother, that there is not a more agreeable\\nyoung man in the world.\"\\n\\nThis inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension\\nof many; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen, for after only a moment's\\nconsideration, she said, in a whisper to Catherine, \"I dare say she\\nthought I was speaking of her son.\"\\n\\nCatherine was disappointed and vexed. She seemed to have missed by so\\nlittle the very object she had had in view; and this persuasion did not\\nincline her to a very gracious reply, when John Thorpe came up to her\\nsoon afterwards and said, \"Well, Miss Morland, I suppose you and I are\\nto stand up and jig it together again.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no; I am much obliged to you, our two dances are over; and,\\nbesides, I am tired, and do not mean to dance any more.\"\\n\\n\"Do not you? Then let us walk about and quiz people. Come along with\\nme, and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my two\\nyounger sisters and their partners. I have been laughing at them this\\nhalf hour.\"\\n\\nAgain Catherine excused herself; and at last he walked off to quiz his\\nsisters by himself. The rest of the evening she found very dull; Mr.\\nTilney was drawn away from their party at tea, to attend that of his\\npartner; Miss Tilney, though belonging to it, did not sit near her, and\\nJames and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the\\nlatter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile, one\\nsqueeze, and one \"dearest Catherine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n\\n\\nThe progress of Catherine's unhappiness from the events of the evening\\nwas as follows. It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with\\neverybody about her, while she remained in the rooms, which speedily\\nbrought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home. This,\\non arriving in Pulteney Street, took the direction of extraordinary\\nhunger, and when that was appeased, changed into an earnest longing to\\nbe in bed; such was the extreme point of her distress; for when there\\nshe immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours, and\\nfrom which she awoke perfectly revived, in excellent spirits, with fresh\\nhopes and fresh schemes. The first wish of her heart was to improve her\\nacquaintance with Miss Tilney, and almost her first resolution, to seek\\nher for that purpose, in the pump-room at noon. In the pump-room, one\\nso newly arrived in Bath must be met with, and that building she had\\nalready found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence,\\nand the completion of female intimacy, so admirably adapted for secret\\ndiscourses and unlimited confidence, that she was most reasonably\\nencouraged to expect another friend from within its walls. Her plan\\nfor the morning thus settled, she sat quietly down to her book after\\nbreakfast, resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment\\ntill the clock struck one; and from habitude very little incommoded by\\nthe remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen, whose vacancy of mind and\\nincapacity for thinking were such, that as she never talked a great\\ndeal, so she could never be entirely silent; and, therefore, while she\\nsat at her work, if she lost her needle or broke her thread, if she\\nheard a carriage in the street, or saw a speck upon her gown, she must\\nobserve it aloud, whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or\\nnot. At about half past twelve, a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste\\nto the window, and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there\\nbeing two open carriages at the door, in the first only a servant,\\nher brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second, before John Thorpe came\\nrunning upstairs, calling out, \"Well, Miss Morland, here I am. Have\\nyou been waiting long? We could not come before; the old devil of a\\ncoachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into,\\nand now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out\\nof the street. How do you do, Mrs. Allen? A famous ball last night, was\\nnot it? Come, Miss Morland, be quick, for the others are in a confounded\\nhurry to be off. They want to get their tumble over.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" said Catherine. \"Where are you all going to?\"\\n\\n\"Going to? Why, you have not forgot our engagement! Did not we agree\\ntogether to take a drive this morning? What a head you have! We are\\ngoing up Claverton Down.\"\\n\\n\"Something was said about it, I remember,\" said Catherine, looking at\\nMrs. Allen for her opinion; \"but really I did not expect you.\"\\n\\n\"Not expect me! That's a good one! And what a dust you would have made,\\nif I had not come.\"\\n\\nCatherine's silent appeal to her friend, meanwhile, was entirely thrown\\naway, for Mrs. Allen, not being at all in the habit of conveying any\\nexpression herself by a look, was not aware of its being ever intended\\nby anybody else; and Catherine, whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again\\ncould at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive, and who\\nthought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe, as\\nIsabella was going at the same time with James, was therefore obliged to\\nspeak plainer. \"Well, ma'am, what do you say to it? Can you spare me for\\nan hour or two? Shall I go?\"\\n\\n\"Do just as you please, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Allen, with the most\\nplacid indifference. Catherine took the advice, and ran off to get\\nready. In a very few minutes she reappeared, having scarcely allowed\\nthe two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her\\npraise, after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen's admiration of his gig;\\nand then receiving her friend's parting good wishes, they both hurried\\ndownstairs. \"My dearest creature,\" cried Isabella, to whom the duty\\nof friendship immediately called her before she could get into the\\ncarriage, \"you have been at least three hours getting ready. I was\\nafraid you were ill. What a delightful ball we had last night. I have a\\nthousand things to say to you; but make haste and get in, for I long to\\nbe off.\"\\n\\nCatherine followed her orders and turned away, but not too soon to hear\\nher friend exclaim aloud to James, \"What a sweet girl she is! I quite\\ndote on her.\"\\n\\n\"You will not be frightened, Miss Morland,\" said Thorpe, as he handed\\nher in, \"if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off.\\nHe will, most likely, give a plunge or two, and perhaps take the rest\\nfor a minute; but he will soon know his master. He is full of spirits,\\nplayful as can be, but there is no vice in him.\"\\n\\nCatherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one, but it was too\\nlate to retreat, and she was too young to own herself frightened; so,\\nresigning herself to her fate, and trusting to the animal's boasted\\nknowledge of its owner, she sat peaceably down, and saw Thorpe sit down\\nby her. Everything being then arranged, the servant who stood at the\\nhorse's head was bid in an important voice \"to let him go,\" and off they\\nwent in the quietest manner imaginable, without a plunge or a caper, or\\nanything like one. Catherine, delighted at so happy an escape, spoke\\nher pleasure aloud with grateful surprise; and her companion immediately\\nmade the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely\\nowing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the\\nreins, and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had\\ndirected his whip. Catherine, though she could not help wondering that\\nwith such perfect command of his horse, he should think it necessary to\\nalarm her with a relation of its tricks, congratulated herself sincerely\\non being under the care of so excellent a coachman; and perceiving that\\nthe animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner, without\\nshowing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity, and\\n(considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour) by no means\\nalarmingly fast, gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and\\nexercise of the most invigorating kind, in a fine mild day of February,\\nwith the consciousness of safety. A silence of several minutes succeeded\\ntheir first short dialogue; it was broken by Thorpe's saying very\\nabruptly, \"Old Allen is as rich as a Jew--is not he?\" Catherine did not\\nunderstand him--and he repeated his question, adding in explanation,\\n\"Old Allen, the man you are with.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Mr. Allen, you mean. Yes, I believe, he is very rich.\"\\n\\n\"And no children at all?\"\\n\\n\"No--not any.\"\\n\\n\"A famous thing for his next heirs. He is your godfather, is not he?\"\\n\\n\"My godfather! No.\"\\n\\n\"But you are always very much with them.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very much.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, that is what I meant. He seems a good kind of old fellow enough,\\nand has lived very well in his time, I dare say; he is not gouty for\\nnothing. Does he drink his bottle a day now?\"\\n\\n\"His bottle a day! No. Why should you think of such a thing? He is a\\nvery temperate man, and you could not fancy him in liquor last night?\"\\n\\n\"Lord help you! You women are always thinking of men's being in liquor.\\nWhy, you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle? I am sure of\\nthis--that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day, there would not\\nbe half the disorders in the world there are now. It would be a famous\\ngood thing for us all.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot believe it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Lord, it would be the saving of thousands. There is not the\\nhundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to\\nbe. Our foggy climate wants help.\"\\n\\n\"And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in\\nOxford.\"\\n\\n\"Oxford! There is no drinking at Oxford now, I assure you. Nobody drinks\\nthere. You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints\\nat the utmost. Now, for instance, it was reckoned a remarkable thing, at\\nthe last party in my rooms, that upon an average we cleared about five\\npints a head. It was looked upon as something out of the common way.\\nMine is famous good stuff, to be sure. You would not often meet with\\nanything like it in Oxford--and that may account for it. But this will\\njust give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it does give a notion,\" said Catherine warmly, \"and that is, that\\nyou all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did. However, I\\nam sure James does not drink so much.\"\\n\\nThis declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply, of which\\nno part was very distinct, except the frequent exclamations, amounting\\nalmost to oaths, which adorned it, and Catherine was left, when it\\nended, with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal\\nof wine drunk in Oxford, and the same happy conviction of her brother's\\ncomparative sobriety.\\n\\nThorpe's ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage, and\\nshe was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse\\nmoved along, and the ease which his paces, as well as the excellence of\\nthe springs, gave the motion of the carriage. She followed him in all\\nhis admiration as well as she could. To go before or beyond him was\\nimpossible. His knowledge and her ignorance of the subject, his rapidity\\nof expression, and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power;\\nshe could strike out nothing new in commendation, but she readily echoed\\nwhatever he chose to assert, and it was finally settled between them\\nwithout any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the most\\ncomplete of its kind in England, his carriage the neatest, his horse the\\nbest goer, and himself the best coachman. \"You do not really think,\\nMr. Thorpe,\" said Catherine, venturing after some time to consider the\\nmatter as entirely decided, and to offer some little variation on the\\nsubject, \"that James's gig will break down?\"\\n\\n\"Break down! Oh! Lord! Did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in\\nyour life? There is not a sound piece of iron about it. The wheels have\\nbeen fairly worn out these ten years at least--and as for the body! Upon\\nmy soul, you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch. It is the\\nmost devilish little rickety business I ever beheld! Thank God! we\\nhave got a better. I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty\\nthousand pounds.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Catherine, quite frightened. \"Then pray let us\\nturn back; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on. Do let\\nus turn back, Mr. Thorpe; stop and speak to my brother, and tell him how\\nvery unsafe it is.\"\\n\\n\"Unsafe! Oh, lord! What is there in that? They will only get a roll if\\nit does break down; and there is plenty of dirt; it will be excellent\\nfalling. Oh, curse it! The carriage is safe enough, if a man knows how\\nto drive it; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty\\nyears after it is fairly worn out. Lord bless you! I would undertake for\\nfive pounds to drive it to York and back again, without losing a nail.\"\\n\\nCatherine listened with astonishment; she knew not how to reconcile two\\nsuch very different accounts of the same thing; for she had not been\\nbrought up to understand the propensities of a rattle, nor to know to\\nhow many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity\\nwill lead. Her own family were plain, matter-of-fact people who seldom\\naimed at wit of any kind; her father, at the utmost, being contented\\nwith a pun, and her mother with a proverb; they were not in the habit\\ntherefore of telling lies to increase their importance, or of asserting\\nat one moment what they would contradict the next. She reflected on the\\naffair for some time in much perplexity, and was more than once on the\\npoint of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his real\\nopinion on the subject; but she checked herself, because it appeared to\\nher that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights, in making\\nthose things plain which he had before made ambiguous; and, joining to\\nthis, the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and\\nhis friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preserve\\nthem, she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact\\nperfectly safe, and therefore would alarm herself no longer. By him\\nthe whole matter seemed entirely forgotten; and all the rest of his\\nconversation, or rather talk, began and ended with himself and his own\\nconcerns. He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle and\\nsold for incredible sums; of racing matches, in which his judgment had\\ninfallibly foretold the winner; of shooting parties, in which he had\\nkilled more birds (though without having one good shot) than all his\\ncompanions together; and described to her some famous day's sport, with\\nthe fox-hounds, in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogs\\nhad repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman, and in which\\nthe boldness of his riding, though it had never endangered his own life\\nfor a moment, had been constantly leading others into difficulties,\\nwhich he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many.\\n\\nLittle as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself, and unfixed\\nas were her general notions of what men ought to be, she could not\\nentirely repress a doubt, while she bore with the effusions of his\\nendless conceit, of his being altogether completely agreeable. It was a\\nbold surmise, for he was Isabella's brother; and she had been assured by\\nJames that his manners would recommend him to all her sex; but in spite\\nof this, the extreme weariness of his company, which crept over her\\nbefore they had been out an hour, and which continued unceasingly to\\nincrease till they stopped in Pulteney Street again, induced her, in\\nsome small degree, to resist such high authority, and to distrust his\\npowers of giving universal pleasure.\\n\\nWhen they arrived at Mrs. Allen's door, the astonishment of Isabella was\\nhardly to be expressed, on finding that it was too late in the day for\\nthem to attend her friend into the house: \"Past three o'clock!\" It was\\ninconceivable, incredible, impossible! And she would neither believe her\\nown watch, nor her brother's, nor the servant's; she would believe no\\nassurance of it founded on reason or reality, till Morland produced his\\nwatch, and ascertained the fact; to have doubted a moment longer then\\nwould have been equally inconceivable, incredible, and impossible; and\\nshe could only protest, over and over again, that no two hours and a\\nhalf had ever gone off so swiftly before, as Catherine was called on to\\nconfirm; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella;\\nbut the latter was spared the misery of her friend's dissenting voice,\\nby not waiting for her answer. Her own feelings entirely engrossed\\nher; her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go\\ndirectly home. It was ages since she had had a moment's conversation\\nwith her dearest Catherine; and, though she had such thousands of things\\nto say to her, it appeared as if they were never to be together again;\\nso, with smiles of most exquisite misery, and the laughing eye of utter\\ndespondency, she bade her friend adieu and went on.\\n\\nCatherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of\\nthe morning, and was immediately greeted with, \"Well, my dear, here\\nyou are,\" a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to\\ndispute; \"and I hope you have had a pleasant airing?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma'am, I thank you; we could not have had a nicer day.\"\\n\\n\"So Mrs. Thorpe said; she was vastly pleased at your all going.\"\\n\\n\"You have seen Mrs. Thorpe, then?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I went to the pump-room as soon as you were gone, and there I met\\nher, and we had a great deal of talk together. She says there was hardly\\nany veal to be got at market this morning, it is so uncommonly scarce.\"\\n\\n\"Did you see anybody else of our acquaintance?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent, and there we met Mrs.\\nHughes, and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her.\"\\n\\n\"Did you indeed? And did they speak to you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour. They seem\\nvery agreeable people. Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted\\nmuslin, and I fancy, by what I can learn, that she always dresses very\\nhandsomely. Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family.\"\\n\\n\"And what did she tell you of them?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! A vast deal indeed; she hardly talked of anything else.\"\\n\\n\"Did she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she did; but I cannot recollect now. But they are very good kind\\nof people, and very rich. Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond, and she\\nand Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows; and Miss Drummond had a very large\\nfortune; and, when she married, her father gave her twenty thousand\\npounds, and five hundred to buy wedding-clothes. Mrs. Hughes saw all the\\nclothes after they came from the warehouse.\"\\n\\n\"And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I fancy they are, but I am not quite certain. Upon recollection,\\nhowever, I have a notion they are both dead; at least the mother is;\\nyes, I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead, because Mrs. Hughes told me there\\nwas a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter\\non her wedding-day and that Miss Tilney has got now, for they were put\\nby for her when her mother died.\"\\n\\n\"And is Mr. Tilney, my partner, the only son?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot be quite positive about that, my dear; I have some idea he is;\\nbut, however, he is a very fine young man, Mrs. Hughes says, and likely\\nto do very well.\"\\n\\nCatherine inquired no further; she had heard enough to feel that\\nMrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give, and that she was most\\nparticularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with\\nboth brother and sister. Could she have foreseen such a circumstance,\\nnothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others; and, as\\nit was, she could only lament her ill luck, and think over what she had\\nlost, till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been very\\npleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10\\n\\n\\nThe Allens, Thorpes, and Morlands all met in the evening at the\\ntheatre; and, as Catherine and Isabella sat together, there was then an\\nopportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand\\nthings which had been collecting within her for communication in the\\nimmeasurable length of time which had divided them. \"Oh, heavens!\\nMy beloved Catherine, have I got you at last?\" was her address on\\nCatherine's entering the box and sitting by her. \"Now, Mr. Morland,\" for\\nhe was close to her on the other side, \"I shall not speak another word\\nto you all the rest of the evening; so I charge you not to expect it. My\\nsweetest Catherine, how have you been this long age? But I need not ask\\nyou, for you look delightfully. You really have done your hair in a\\nmore heavenly style than ever; you mischievous creature, do you want to\\nattract everybody? I assure you, my brother is quite in love with you\\nalready; and as for Mr. Tilney--but that is a settled thing--even your\\nmodesty cannot doubt his attachment now; his coming back to Bath makes\\nit too plain. Oh! What would not I give to see him! I really am quite\\nwild with impatience. My mother says he is the most delightful young man\\nin the world; she saw him this morning, you know; you must introduce him\\nto me. Is he in the house now? Look about, for heaven's sake! I assure\\nyou, I can hardly exist till I see him.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Catherine, \"he is not here; I cannot see him anywhere.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, horrid! Am I never to be acquainted with him? How do you like my\\ngown? I think it does not look amiss; the sleeves were entirely my own\\nthought. Do you know, I get so immoderately sick of Bath; your brother\\nand I were agreeing this morning that, though it is vastly well to be\\nhere for a few weeks, we would not live here for millions. We soon found\\nout that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to\\nevery other place; really, our opinions were so exactly the same, it was\\nquite ridiculous! There was not a single point in which we differed; I\\nwould not have had you by for the world; you are such a sly thing, I am\\nsure you would have made some droll remark or other about it.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed I should not.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes you would indeed; I know you better than you know yourself. You\\nwould have told us that we seemed born for each other, or some nonsense\\nof that kind, which would have distressed me beyond conception; my\\ncheeks would have been as red as your roses; I would not have had you by\\nfor the world.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you do me injustice; I would not have made so improper a remark\\nupon any account; and besides, I am sure it would never have entered my\\nhead.\"\\n\\nIsabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to\\nJames.\\n\\nCatherine's resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again\\ncontinued in full force the next morning; and till the usual moment of\\ngoing to the pump-room, she felt some alarm from the dread of a second\\nprevention. But nothing of that kind occurred, no visitors appeared to\\ndelay them, and they all three set off in good time for the pump-room,\\nwhere the ordinary course of events and conversation took place; Mr.\\nAllen, after drinking his glass of water, joined some gentlemen to\\ntalk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their\\nnewspapers; and the ladies walked about together, noticing every new\\nface, and almost every new bonnet in the room. The female part of the\\nThorpe family, attended by James Morland, appeared among the crowd in\\nless than a quarter of an hour, and Catherine immediately took her\\nusual place by the side of her friend. James, who was now in constant\\nattendance, maintained a similar position, and separating themselves\\nfrom the rest of their party, they walked in that manner for some\\ntime, till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which,\\nconfining her entirely to her friend and brother, gave her very\\nlittle share in the notice of either. They were always engaged in\\nsome sentimental discussion or lively dispute, but their sentiment was\\nconveyed in such whispering voices, and their vivacity attended with\\nso much laughter, that though Catherine's supporting opinion was not\\nunfrequently called for by one or the other, she was never able to give\\nany, from not having heard a word of the subject. At length however\\nshe was empowered to disengage herself from her friend, by the avowed\\nnecessity of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom she most joyfully saw just\\nentering the room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom she instantly joined, with\\na firmer determination to be acquainted, than she might have had courage\\nto command, had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day\\nbefore. Miss Tilney met her with great civility, returned her advances\\nwith equal goodwill, and they continued talking together as long as\\nboth parties remained in the room; and though in all probability not\\nan observation was made, nor an expression used by either which had not\\nbeen made and used some thousands of times before, under that roof, in\\nevery Bath season, yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity\\nand truth, and without personal conceit, might be something uncommon.\\n\\n\"How well your brother dances!\" was an artless exclamation of\\nCatherine's towards the close of their conversation, which at once\\nsurprised and amused her companion.\\n\\n\"Henry!\" she replied with a smile. \"Yes, he does dance very well.\"\\n\\n\"He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other\\nevening, when he saw me sitting down. But I really had been engaged\\nthe whole day to Mr. Thorpe.\" Miss Tilney could only bow. \"You cannot\\nthink,\" added Catherine after a moment's silence, \"how surprised I was\\nto see him again. I felt so sure of his being quite gone away.\"\\n\\n\"When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before, he was in Bath but\\nfor a couple of days. He came only to engage lodgings for us.\"\\n\\n\"That never occurred to me; and of course, not seeing him anywhere, I\\nthought he must be gone. Was not the young lady he danced with on Monday\\na Miss Smith?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say she was very glad to dance. Do you think her pretty?\"\\n\\n\"Not very.\"\\n\\n\"He never comes to the pump-room, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sometimes; but he has rid out this morning with my father.\"\\n\\nMrs. Hughes now joined them, and asked Miss Tilney if she was ready to\\ngo. \"I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon,\" said\\nCatherine. \"Shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps we--Yes, I think we certainly shall.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of it, for we shall all be there.\" This civility was duly\\nreturned; and they parted--on Miss Tilney's side with some knowledge\\nof her new acquaintance's feelings, and on Catherine's, without the\\nsmallest consciousness of having explained them.\\n\\nShe went home very happy. The morning had answered all her hopes, and\\nthe evening of the following day was now the object of expectation,\\nthe future good. What gown and what head-dress she should wear on the\\noccasion became her chief concern. She cannot be justified in it. Dress\\nis at all times a frivolous distinction, and excessive solicitude about\\nit often destroys its own aim. Catherine knew all this very well; her\\ngreat aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas\\nbefore; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating\\nbetween her spotted and her tamboured muslin, and nothing but the\\nshortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening.\\nThis would have been an error in judgment, great though not uncommon,\\nfrom which one of the other sex rather than her own, a brother rather\\nthan a great aunt, might have warned her, for man only can be aware of\\nthe insensibility of man towards a new gown. It would be mortifying to\\nthe feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little\\nthe heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire;\\nhow little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and how\\nunsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged,\\nthe mull, or the jackonet. Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone.\\nNo man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for\\nit. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of\\nshabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter. But not\\none of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of Catherine.\\n\\nShe entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different\\nfrom what had attended her thither the Monday before. She had then been\\nexulting in her engagement to Thorpe, and was now chiefly anxious to\\navoid his sight, lest he should engage her again; for though she could\\nnot, dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her a third time to\\ndance, her wishes, hopes, and plans all centred in nothing less. Every\\nyoung lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for every\\nyoung lady has at some time or other known the same agitation. All have\\nbeen, or at least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from the\\npursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid; and all have been anxious\\nfor the attentions of someone whom they wished to please. As soon as\\nthey were joined by the Thorpes, Catherine's agony began; she fidgeted\\nabout if John Thorpe came towards her, hid herself as much as possible\\nfrom his view, and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him. The\\ncotillions were over, the country-dancing beginning, and she saw nothing\\nof the Tilneys.\\n\\n\"Do not be frightened, my dear Catherine,\" whispered Isabella, \"but I am\\nreally going to dance with your brother again. I declare positively it\\nis quite shocking. I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself, but you\\nand John must keep us in countenance. Make haste, my dear creature, and\\ncome to us. John is just walked off, but he will be back in a moment.\"\\n\\nCatherine had neither time nor inclination to answer. The others walked\\naway, John Thorpe was still in view, and she gave herself up for lost.\\nThat she might not appear, however, to observe or expect him, she kept\\nher eyes intently fixed on her fan; and a self-condemnation for her\\nfolly, in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with\\nthe Tilneys in any reasonable time, had just passed through her mind,\\nwhen she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance,\\nby Mr. Tilney himself. With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she\\ngranted his request, and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went\\nwith him to the set, may be easily imagined. To escape, and, as\\nshe believed, so narrowly escape John Thorpe, and to be asked, so\\nimmediately on his joining her, asked by Mr. Tilney, as if he had sought\\nher on purpose!--it did not appear to her that life could supply any\\ngreater felicity.\\n\\nScarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a\\nplace, however, when her attention was claimed by John Thorpe, who stood\\nbehind her. \"Heyday, Miss Morland!\" said he. \"What is the meaning of\\nthis? I thought you and I were to dance together.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder you should think so, for you never asked me.\"\\n\\n\"That is a good one, by Jove! I asked you as soon as I came into the\\nroom, and I was just going to ask you again, but when I turned round,\\nyou were gone! This is a cursed shabby trick! I only came for the sake\\nof dancing with you, and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever\\nsince Monday. Yes; I remember, I asked you while you were waiting in the\\nlobby for your cloak. And here have I been telling all my acquaintance\\nthat I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room; and\\nwhen they see you standing up with somebody else, they will quiz me\\nfamously.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no; they will never think of me, after such a description as that.\"\\n\\n\"By heavens, if they do not, I will kick them out of the room for\\nblockheads. What chap have you there?\" Catherine satisfied his\\ncuriosity. \"Tilney,\" he repeated. \"Hum--I do not know him. A good figure\\nof a man; well put together. Does he want a horse? Here is a friend\\nof mine, Sam Fletcher, has got one to sell that would suit anybody. A\\nfamous clever animal for the road--only forty guineas. I had fifty minds\\nto buy it myself, for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse\\nwhen I meet with one; but it would not answer my purpose, it would not\\ndo for the field. I would give any money for a real good hunter. I\\nhave three now, the best that ever were backed. I would not take\\neight hundred guineas for them. Fletcher and I mean to get a house in\\nLeicestershire, against the next season. It is so d--uncomfortable,\\nliving at an inn.\"\\n\\nThis was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine's\\nattention, for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of\\na long string of passing ladies. Her partner now drew near, and said,\\n\"That gentleman would have put me out of patience, had he stayed with\\nyou half a minute longer. He has no business to withdraw the attention\\nof my partner from me. We have entered into a contract of mutual\\nagreeableness for the space of an evening, and all our agreeableness\\nbelongs solely to each other for that time. Nobody can fasten themselves\\non the notice of one, without injuring the rights of the other.\\nI consider a country-dance as an emblem of marriage. Fidelity and\\ncomplaisance are the principal duties of both; and those men who do not\\nchoose to dance or marry themselves, have no business with the partners\\nor wives of their neighbours.\"\\n\\n\"But they are such very different things!\"\\n\\n\"--That you think they cannot be compared together.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure not. People that marry can never part, but must go and keep\\nhouse together. People that dance only stand opposite each other in a\\nlong room for half an hour.\"\\n\\n\"And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing. Taken in that\\nlight certainly, their resemblance is not striking; but I think I could\\nplace them in such a view. You will allow, that in both, man has the\\nadvantage of choice, woman only the power of refusal; that in both,\\nit is an engagement between man and woman, formed for the advantage of\\neach; and that when once entered into, they belong exclusively to each\\nother till the moment of its dissolution; that it is their duty, each\\nto endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had\\nbestowed themselves elsewhere, and their best interest to keep their own\\nimaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours,\\nor fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else. You\\nwill allow all this?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, to be sure, as you state it, all this sounds very well; but still\\nthey are so very different. I cannot look upon them at all in the same\\nlight, nor think the same duties belong to them.\"\\n\\n\"In one respect, there certainly is a difference. In marriage, the man\\nis supposed to provide for the support of the woman, the woman to make\\nthe home agreeable to the man; he is to purvey, and she is to smile.\\nBut in dancing, their duties are exactly changed; the agreeableness, the\\ncompliance are expected from him, while she furnishes the fan and the\\nlavender water. That, I suppose, was the difference of duties which\\nstruck you, as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I never thought of that.\"\\n\\n\"Then I am quite at a loss. One thing, however, I must observe. This\\ndisposition on your side is rather alarming. You totally disallow any\\nsimilarity in the obligations; and may I not thence infer that your\\nnotions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your\\npartner might wish? Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who\\nspoke to you just now were to return, or if any other gentleman were to\\naddress you, there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with\\nhim as long as you chose?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother's, that if he\\ntalks to me, I must talk to him again; but there are hardly three young\\nmen in the room besides him that I have any acquaintance with.\"\\n\\n\"And is that to be my only security? Alas, alas!\"\\n\\n\"Nay, I am sure you cannot have a better; for if I do not know anybody,\\nit is impossible for me to talk to them; and, besides, I do not want to\\ntalk to anybody.\"\\n\\n\"Now you have given me a security worth having; and I shall proceed\\nwith courage. Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of\\nmaking the inquiry before?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, quite--more so, indeed.\"\\n\\n\"More so! Take care, or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper\\ntime. You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think I should be tired, if I were to stay here six months.\"\\n\\n\"Bath, compared with London, has little variety, and so everybody finds\\nout every year. 'For six weeks, I allow Bath is pleasant enough; but\\nbeyond that, it is the most tiresome place in the world.' You would be\\ntold so by people of all descriptions, who come regularly every winter,\\nlengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve, and go away at last because\\nthey can afford to stay no longer.\"\\n\\n\"Well, other people must judge for themselves, and those who go to\\nLondon may think nothing of Bath. But I, who live in a small retired\\nvillage in the country, can never find greater sameness in such a place\\nas this than in my own home; for here are a variety of amusements, a\\nvariety of things to be seen and done all day long, which I can know\\nnothing of there.\"\\n\\n\"You are not fond of the country.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I am. I have always lived there, and always been very happy. But\\ncertainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a Bath\\nlife. One day in the country is exactly like another.\"\\n\\n\"But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country.\"\\n\\n\"Do I?\"\\n\\n\"Do you not?\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe there is much difference.\"\\n\\n\"Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long.\"\\n\\n\"And so I am at home--only I do not find so much of it. I walk about\\nhere, and so I do there; but here I see a variety of people in every\\nstreet, and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen.\"\\n\\nMr. Tilney was very much amused.\\n\\n\"Only go and call on Mrs. Allen!\" he repeated. \"What a picture of\\nintellectual poverty! However, when you sink into this abyss again, you\\nwill have more to say. You will be able to talk of Bath, and of all that\\nyou did here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Yes. I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs.\\nAllen, or anybody else. I really believe I shall always be talking of\\nBath, when I am at home again--I do like it so very much. If I could but\\nhave Papa and Mamma, and the rest of them here, I suppose I should be\\ntoo happy! James's coming (my eldest brother) is quite delightful--and\\nespecially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so\\nintimate with are his intimate friends already. Oh! Who can ever be\\ntired of Bath?\"\\n\\n\"Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do.\\nBut papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends are a good deal\\ngone by, to most of the frequenters of Bath--and the honest relish of\\nballs and plays, and everyday sights, is past with them.\" Here\\ntheir conversation closed, the demands of the dance becoming now too\\nimportunate for a divided attention.\\n\\nSoon after their reaching the bottom of the set, Catherine perceived\\nherself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the\\nlookers-on, immediately behind her partner. He was a very handsome man,\\nof a commanding aspect, past the bloom, but not past the vigour of\\nlife; and with his eye still directed towards her, she saw him presently\\naddress Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper. Confused by his notice, and\\nblushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in\\nher appearance, she turned away her head. But while she did so, the\\ngentleman retreated, and her partner, coming nearer, said, \"I see that\\nyou guess what I have just been asked. That gentleman knows your name,\\nand you have a right to know his. It is General Tilney, my father.\"\\n\\nCatherine's answer was only \"Oh!\"--but it was an \"Oh!\" expressing\\neverything needful: attention to his words, and perfect reliance on\\ntheir truth. With real interest and strong admiration did her eye now\\nfollow the general, as he moved through the crowd, and \"How handsome a\\nfamily they are!\" was her secret remark.\\n\\nIn chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded, a new source\\nof felicity arose to her. She had never taken a country walk since\\nher arrival in Bath. Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequented\\nenvirons were familiar, spoke of them in terms which made her all\\neagerness to know them too; and on her openly fearing that she might\\nfind nobody to go with her, it was proposed by the brother and sister\\nthat they should join in a walk, some morning or other. \"I shall like\\nit,\" she cried, \"beyond anything in the world; and do not let us put\\nit off--let us go tomorrow.\" This was readily agreed to, with only a\\nproviso of Miss Tilney's, that it did not rain, which Catherine was sure\\nit would not. At twelve o'clock, they were to call for her in Pulteney\\nStreet; and \"Remember--twelve o'clock,\" was her parting speech to\\nher new friend. Of her other, her older, her more established friend,\\nIsabella, of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight's\\nexperience, she scarcely saw anything during the evening. Yet, though\\nlonging to make her acquainted with her happiness, she cheerfully\\nsubmitted to the wish of Mr. Allen, which took them rather early away,\\nand her spirits danced within her, as she danced in her chair all the\\nway home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 11\\n\\n\\nThe morrow brought a very sober-looking morning, the sun making only\\na few efforts to appear, and Catherine augured from it everything most\\nfavourable to her wishes. A bright morning so early in the year,\\nshe allowed, would generally turn to rain, but a cloudy one foretold\\nimprovement as the day advanced. She applied to Mr. Allen for\\nconfirmation of her hopes, but Mr. Allen, not having his own skies and\\nbarometer about him, declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine.\\nShe applied to Mrs. Allen, and Mrs. Allen's opinion was more positive.\\n\"She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day, if the\\nclouds would only go off, and the sun keep out.\"\\n\\nAt about eleven o'clock, however, a few specks of small rain upon the\\nwindows caught Catherine's watchful eye, and \"Oh! dear, I do believe it\\nwill be wet,\" broke from her in a most desponding tone.\\n\\n\"I thought how it would be,\" said Mrs. Allen.\\n\\n\"No walk for me today,\" sighed Catherine; \"but perhaps it may come to\\nnothing, or it may hold up before twelve.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it may, but then, my dear, it will be so dirty.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! That will not signify; I never mind dirt.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied her friend very placidly, \"I know you never mind dirt.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause, \"It comes on faster and faster!\" said Catherine, as\\nshe stood watching at a window.\\n\\n\"So it does indeed. If it keeps raining, the streets will be very wet.\"\\n\\n\"There are four umbrellas up already. How I hate the sight of an\\numbrella!\"\\n\\n\"They are disagreeable things to carry. I would much rather take a chair\\nat any time.\"\\n\\n\"It was such a nice-looking morning! I felt so convinced it would be\\ndry!\"\\n\\n\"Anybody would have thought so indeed. There will be very few people in\\nthe pump-room, if it rains all the morning. I hope Mr. Allen will put\\non his greatcoat when he goes, but I dare say he will not, for he had\\nrather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat; I wonder\\nhe should dislike it, it must be so comfortable.\"\\n\\nThe rain continued--fast, though not heavy. Catherine went every five\\nminutes to the clock, threatening on each return that, if it still\\nkept on raining another five minutes, she would give up the matter as\\nhopeless. The clock struck twelve, and it still rained. \"You will not be\\nable to go, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"I do not quite despair yet. I shall not give it up till a quarter after\\ntwelve. This is just the time of day for it to clear up, and I do think\\nit looks a little lighter. There, it is twenty minutes after twelve, and\\nnow I shall give it up entirely. Oh! That we had such weather here\\nas they had at Udolpho, or at least in Tuscany and the south of\\nFrance!--the night that poor St. Aubin died!--such beautiful weather!\"\\n\\nAt half past twelve, when Catherine's anxious attention to the weather\\nwas over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment, the\\nsky began voluntarily to clear. A gleam of sunshine took her quite by\\nsurprise; she looked round; the clouds were parting, and she instantly\\nreturned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance.\\nTen minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed,\\nand justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen, who had \"always thought it\\nwould clear up.\" But whether Catherine might still expect her friends,\\nwhether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture,\\nmust yet be a question.\\n\\nIt was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to the\\npump-room; he accordingly set off by himself, and Catherine had barely\\nwatched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approach\\nof the same two open carriages, containing the same three people that\\nhad surprised her so much a few mornings back.\\n\\n\"Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe, I declare! They are coming for\\nme perhaps--but I shall not go--I cannot go indeed, for you know Miss\\nTilney may still call.\" Mrs. Allen agreed to it. John Thorpe was soon\\nwith them, and his voice was with them yet sooner, for on the stairs he\\nwas calling out to Miss Morland to be quick. \"Make haste! Make haste!\"\\nas he threw open the door. \"Put on your hat this moment--there is no\\ntime to be lost--we are going to Bristol. How d'ye do, Mrs. Allen?\"\\n\\n\"To Bristol! Is not that a great way off? But, however, I cannot go with\\nyou today, because I am engaged; I expect some friends every moment.\"\\nThis was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all; Mrs.\\nAllen was called on to second him, and the two others walked in, to give\\ntheir assistance. \"My sweetest Catherine, is not this delightful? We\\nshall have a most heavenly drive. You are to thank your brother and me\\nfor the scheme; it darted into our heads at breakfast-time, I verily\\nbelieve at the same instant; and we should have been off two hours ago\\nif it had not been for this detestable rain. But it does not signify,\\nthe nights are moonlight, and we shall do delightfully. Oh! I am in such\\necstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet! So much\\nbetter than going to the Lower Rooms. We shall drive directly to Clifton\\nand dine there; and, as soon as dinner is over, if there is time for it,\\ngo on to Kingsweston.\"\\n\\n\"I doubt our being able to do so much,\" said Morland.\\n\\n\"You croaking fellow!\" cried Thorpe. \"We shall be able to do ten times\\nmore. Kingsweston! Aye, and Blaize Castle too, and anything else we can\\nhear of; but here is your sister says she will not go.\"\\n\\n\"Blaize Castle!\" cried Catherine. \"What is that?\"\\n\\n\"The finest place in England--worth going fifty miles at any time to\\nsee.\"\\n\\n\"What, is it really a castle, an old castle?\"\\n\\n\"The oldest in the kingdom.\"\\n\\n\"But is it like what one reads of?\"\\n\\n\"Exactly--the very same.\"\\n\\n\"But now really--are there towers and long galleries?\"\\n\\n\"By dozens.\"\\n\\n\"Then I should like to see it; but I cannot--I cannot go.\"\\n\\n\"Not go! My beloved creature, what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot go, because\"--looking down as she spoke, fearful of Isabella's\\nsmile--\"I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a\\ncountry walk. They promised to come at twelve, only it rained; but now,\\nas it is so fine, I dare say they will be here soon.\"\\n\\n\"Not they indeed,\" cried Thorpe; \"for, as we turned into Broad Street, I\\nsaw them--does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know indeed.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know he does; I saw him. You are talking of the man you danced\\nwith last night, are not you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road, driving a\\nsmart-looking girl.\"\\n\\n\"Did you indeed?\"\\n\\n\"Did upon my soul; knew him again directly, and he seemed to have got\\nsome very pretty cattle too.\"\\n\\n\"It is very odd! But I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a\\nwalk.\"\\n\\n\"And well they might, for I never saw so much dirt in my life. Walk!\\nYou could no more walk than you could fly! It has not been so dirty the\\nwhole winter; it is ankle-deep everywhere.\"\\n\\nIsabella corroborated it: \"My dearest Catherine, you cannot form an idea\\nof the dirt; come, you must go; you cannot refuse going now.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to see the castle; but may we go all over it? May we go\\nup every staircase, and into every suite of rooms?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, every hole and corner.\"\\n\\n\"But then, if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer,\\nand call by and by?\"\\n\\n\"Make yourself easy, there is no danger of that, for I heard Tilney\\nhallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback, that they were\\ngoing as far as Wick Rocks.\"\\n\\n\"Then I will. Shall I go, Mrs. Allen?\"\\n\\n\"Just as you please, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Allen, you must persuade her to go,\" was the general cry. Mrs.\\nAllen was not inattentive to it: \"Well, my dear,\" said she, \"suppose you\\ngo.\" And in two minutes they were off.\\n\\nCatherine's feelings, as she got into the carriage, were in a very\\nunsettled state; divided between regret for the loss of one great\\npleasure, and the hope of soon enjoying another, almost its equal in\\ndegree, however unlike in kind. She could not think the Tilneys had\\nacted quite well by her, in so readily giving up their engagement,\\nwithout sending her any message of excuse. It was now but an hour later\\nthan the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk; and, in spite of\\nwhat she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course\\nof that hour, she could not from her own observation help thinking that\\nthey might have gone with very little inconvenience. To feel herself\\nslighted by them was very painful. On the other hand, the delight of\\nexploring an edifice like Udolpho, as her fancy represented Blaize\\nCastle to be, was such a counterpoise of good as might console her for\\nalmost anything.\\n\\nThey passed briskly down Pulteney Street, and through Laura Place,\\nwithout the exchange of many words. Thorpe talked to his horse, and she\\nmeditated, by turns, on broken promises and broken arches, phaetons\\nand false hangings, Tilneys and trap-doors. As they entered Argyle\\nBuildings, however, she was roused by this address from her companion,\\n\"Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by?\"\\n\\n\"Who? Where?\"\\n\\n\"On the right-hand pavement--she must be almost out of sight now.\"\\nCatherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother's arm,\\nwalking slowly down the street. She saw them both looking back at her.\\n\"Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe,\" she impatiently cried; \"it is Miss Tilney; it\\nis indeed. How could you tell me they were gone? Stop, stop, I will\\nget out this moment and go to them.\" But to what purpose did she speak?\\nThorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot; the Tilneys, who had\\nsoon ceased to look after her, were in a moment out of sight round the\\ncorner of Laura Place, and in another moment she was herself whisked\\ninto the marketplace. Still, however, and during the length of another\\nstreet, she entreated him to stop. \"Pray, pray stop, Mr. Thorpe. I\\ncannot go on. I will not go on. I must go back to Miss Tilney.\" But Mr.\\nThorpe only laughed, smacked his whip, encouraged his horse, made odd\\nnoises, and drove on; and Catherine, angry and vexed as she was, having\\nno power of getting away, was obliged to give up the point and submit.\\nHer reproaches, however, were not spared. \"How could you deceive me so,\\nMr. Thorpe? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown\\nRoad? I would not have had it happen so for the world. They must think\\nit so strange, so rude of me! To go by them, too, without saying a word!\\nYou do not know how vexed I am; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton, nor\\nin anything else. I had rather, ten thousand times rather, get out now,\\nand walk back to them. How could you say you saw them driving out in a\\nphaeton?\" Thorpe defended himself very stoutly, declared he had never\\nseen two men so much alike in his life, and would hardly give up the\\npoint of its having been Tilney himself.\\n\\nTheir drive, even when this subject was over, was not likely to be very\\nagreeable. Catherine's complaisance was no longer what it had been in\\ntheir former airing. She listened reluctantly, and her replies were\\nshort. Blaize Castle remained her only comfort; towards that, she still\\nlooked at intervals with pleasure; though rather than be disappointed of\\nthe promised walk, and especially rather than be thought ill of by the\\nTilneys, she would willingly have given up all the happiness which its\\nwalls could supply--the happiness of a progress through a long suite of\\nlofty rooms, exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture, though\\nnow for many years deserted--the happiness of being stopped in their way\\nalong narrow, winding vaults, by a low, grated door; or even of having\\ntheir lamp, their only lamp, extinguished by a sudden gust of wind, and\\nof being left in total darkness. In the meanwhile, they proceeded on\\ntheir journey without any mischance, and were within view of the town\\nof Keynsham, when a halloo from Morland, who was behind them, made his\\nfriend pull up, to know what was the matter. The others then came close\\nenough for conversation, and Morland said, \"We had better go back,\\nThorpe; it is too late to go on today; your sister thinks so as well as\\nI. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street, very little\\nmore than seven miles; and, I suppose, we have at least eight more to\\ngo. It will never do. We set out a great deal too late. We had much\\nbetter put it off till another day, and turn round.\"\\n\\n\"It is all one to me,\" replied Thorpe rather angrily; and instantly\\nturning his horse, they were on their way back to Bath.\\n\\n\"If your brother had not got such a d--beast to drive,\" said he soon\\nafterwards, \"we might have done it very well. My horse would have\\ntrotted to Clifton within the hour, if left to himself, and I have\\nalmost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken-winded\\njade's pace. Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his\\nown.\"\\n\\n\"No, he is not,\" said Catherine warmly, \"for I am sure he could not\\nafford it.\"\\n\\n\"And why cannot he afford it?\"\\n\\n\"Because he has not money enough.\"\\n\\n\"And whose fault is that?\"\\n\\n\"Nobody's, that I know of.\" Thorpe then said something in the loud,\\nincoherent way to which he had often recourse, about its being a\\nd--thing to be miserly; and that if people who rolled in money could not\\nafford things, he did not know who could, which Catherine did not even\\nendeavour to understand. Disappointed of what was to have been the\\nconsolation for her first disappointment, she was less and less disposed\\neither to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so; and they\\nreturned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words.\\n\\nAs she entered the house, the footman told her that a gentleman and lady\\nhad called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off;\\nthat, when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe, the lady had\\nasked whether any message had been left for her; and on his saying no,\\nhad felt for a card, but said she had none about her, and went away.\\nPondering over these heart-rending tidings, Catherine walked slowly\\nupstairs. At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen, who, on hearing\\nthe reason of their speedy return, said, \"I am glad your brother had so\\nmuch sense; I am glad you are come back. It was a strange, wild scheme.\"\\n\\nThey all spent the evening together at Thorpe's. Catherine was disturbed\\nand out of spirits; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce, in\\nthe fate of which she shared, by private partnership with Morland, a\\nvery good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton.\\nHer satisfaction, too, in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more\\nthan once. \"How I pity the poor creatures that are going there! How glad\\nI am that I am not amongst them! I wonder whether it will be a full ball\\nor not! They have not begun dancing yet. I would not be there for\\nall the world. It is so delightful to have an evening now and then\\nto oneself. I dare say it will not be a very good ball. I know the\\nMitchells will not be there. I am sure I pity everybody that is. But I\\ndare say, Mr. Morland, you long to be at it, do not you? I am sure you\\ndo. Well, pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you. I dare say\\nwe could do very well without you; but you men think yourselves of such\\nconsequence.\"\\n\\nCatherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in\\ntenderness towards herself and her sorrows, so very little did they\\nappear to dwell on her mind, and so very inadequate was the comfort she\\noffered. \"Do not be so dull, my dearest creature,\" she whispered. \"You\\nwill quite break my heart. It was amazingly shocking, to be sure; but\\nthe Tilneys were entirely to blame. Why were not they more punctual?\\nIt was dirty, indeed, but what did that signify? I am sure John and I\\nshould not have minded it. I never mind going through anything, where a\\nfriend is concerned; that is my disposition, and John is just the same;\\nhe has amazing strong feelings. Good heavens! What a delightful hand you\\nhave got! Kings, I vow! I never was so happy in my life! I would fifty\\ntimes rather you should have them than myself.\"\\n\\nAnd now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch, which is the\\ntrue heroine's portion; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with\\ntears. And lucky may she think herself, if she get another good night's\\nrest in the course of the next three months.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 12\\n\\n\\n\"Mrs. Allen,\" said Catherine the next morning, \"will there be any harm\\nin my calling on Miss Tilney today? I shall not be easy till I have\\nexplained everything.\"\\n\\n\"Go, by all means, my dear; only put on a white gown; Miss Tilney always\\nwears white.\"\\n\\nCatherine cheerfully complied, and being properly equipped, was more\\nimpatient than ever to be at the pump-room, that she might inform\\nherself of General Tilney's lodgings, for though she believed they were\\nin Milsom Street, she was not certain of the house, and Mrs. Allen's\\nwavering convictions only made it more doubtful. To Milsom Street she\\nwas directed, and having made herself perfect in the number, hastened\\naway with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit, explain her\\nconduct, and be forgiven; tripping lightly through the church-yard, and\\nresolutely turning away her eyes, that she might not be obliged to\\nsee her beloved Isabella and her dear family, who, she had reason to\\nbelieve, were in a shop hard by. She reached the house without any\\nimpediment, looked at the number, knocked at the door, and inquired for\\nMiss Tilney. The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home, but was not\\nquite certain. Would she be pleased to send up her name? She gave her\\ncard. In a few minutes the servant returned, and with a look which did\\nnot quite confirm his words, said he had been mistaken, for that Miss\\nTilney was walked out. Catherine, with a blush of mortification, left\\nthe house. She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney was at home, and\\ntoo much offended to admit her; and as she retired down the street,\\ncould not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows, in\\nexpectation of seeing her there, but no one appeared at them. At the\\nbottom of the street, however, she looked back again, and then, not at a\\nwindow, but issuing from the door, she saw Miss Tilney herself. She was\\nfollowed by a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be her father,\\nand they turned up towards Edgar's Buildings. Catherine, in deep\\nmortification, proceeded on her way. She could almost be angry herself\\nat such angry incivility; but she checked the resentful sensation; she\\nremembered her own ignorance. She knew not how such an offence as hers\\nmight be classed by the laws of worldly politeness, to what a degree\\nof unforgivingness it might with propriety lead, nor to what rigours of\\nrudeness in return it might justly make her amenable.\\n\\nDejected and humbled, she had even some thoughts of not going with the\\nothers to the theatre that night; but it must be confessed that they\\nwere not of long continuance, for she soon recollected, in the first\\nplace, that she was without any excuse for staying at home; and, in the\\nsecond, that it was a play she wanted very much to see. To the theatre\\naccordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her;\\nshe feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness\\nfor plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was because they were\\nhabituated to the finer performances of the London stage, which she\\nknew, on Isabella's authority, rendered everything else of the kind\\n\"quite horrid.\" She was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure;\\nthe comedy so well suspended her care that no one, observing her during\\nthe first four acts, would have supposed she had any wretchedness about\\nher. On the beginning of the fifth, however, the sudden view of Mr.\\nHenry Tilney and his father, joining a party in the opposite box,\\nrecalled her to anxiety and distress. The stage could no longer excite\\ngenuine merriment--no longer keep her whole attention. Every other look\\nupon an average was directed towards the opposite box; and, for the\\nspace of two entire scenes, did she thus watch Henry Tilney, without\\nbeing once able to catch his eye. No longer could he be suspected of\\nindifference for a play; his notice was never withdrawn from the stage\\nduring two whole scenes. At length, however, he did look towards her,\\nand he bowed--but such a bow! No smile, no continued observance attended\\nit; his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction.\\nCatherine was restlessly miserable; she could almost have run round to\\nthe box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation. Feelings\\nrather natural than heroic possessed her; instead of considering her\\nown dignity injured by this ready condemnation--instead of proudly\\nresolving, in conscious innocence, to show her resentment towards him\\nwho could harbour a doubt of it, to leave to him all the trouble\\nof seeking an explanation, and to enlighten him on the past only by\\navoiding his sight, or flirting with somebody else--she took to herself\\nall the shame of misconduct, or at least of its appearance, and was only\\neager for an opportunity of explaining its cause.\\n\\nThe play concluded--the curtain fell--Henry Tilney was no longer to be\\nseen where he had hitherto sat, but his father remained, and perhaps he\\nmight be now coming round to their box. She was right; in a few minutes\\nhe appeared, and, making his way through the then thinning rows, spoke\\nwith like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her friend. Not with such\\ncalmness was he answered by the latter: \"Oh! Mr. Tilney, I have been\\nquite wild to speak to you, and make my apologies. You must have thought\\nme so rude; but indeed it was not my own fault, was it, Mrs. Allen?\\nDid not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in a\\nphaeton together? And then what could I do? But I had ten thousand times\\nrather have been with you; now had not I, Mrs. Allen?\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you tumble my gown,\" was Mrs. Allen's reply.\\n\\nHer assurance, however, standing sole as it did, was not thrown away; it\\nbrought a more cordial, more natural smile into his countenance, and\\nhe replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve:\\n\"We were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk\\nafter our passing you in Argyle Street: you were so kind as to look back\\non purpose.\"\\n\\n\"But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk; I never thought of such\\na thing; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop; I called out to\\nhim as soon as ever I saw you; now, Mrs. Allen, did not--Oh! You were\\nnot there; but indeed I did; and, if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped,\\nI would have jumped out and run after you.\"\\n\\nIs there a Henry in the world who could be insensible to such a\\ndeclaration? Henry Tilney at least was not. With a yet sweeter smile, he\\nsaid everything that need be said of his sister's concern, regret, and\\ndependence on Catherine's honour. \"Oh! Do not say Miss Tilney was not\\nangry,\" cried Catherine, \"because I know she was; for she would not see\\nme this morning when I called; I saw her walk out of the house the next\\nminute after my leaving it; I was hurt, but I was not affronted. Perhaps\\nyou did not know I had been there.\"\\n\\n\"I was not within at the time; but I heard of it from Eleanor, and she\\nhas been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of such\\nincivility; but perhaps I can do it as well. It was nothing more than\\nthat my father--they were just preparing to walk out, and he being\\nhurried for time, and not caring to have it put off--made a point of her\\nbeing denied. That was all, I do assure you. She was very much vexed,\\nand meant to make her apology as soon as possible.\"\\n\\nCatherine's mind was greatly eased by this information, yet a something\\nof solicitude remained, from which sprang the following question,\\nthoroughly artless in itself, though rather distressing to the\\ngentleman: \"But, Mr. Tilney, why were you less generous than your\\nsister? If she felt such confidence in my good intentions, and could\\nsuppose it to be only a mistake, why should you be so ready to take\\noffence?\"\\n\\n\"Me! I take offence!\"\\n\\n\"Nay, I am sure by your look, when you came into the box, you were\\nangry.\"\\n\\n\"I angry! I could have no right.\"\\n\\n\"Well, nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face.\" He\\nreplied by asking her to make room for him, and talking of the play.\\n\\nHe remained with them some time, and was only too agreeable for\\nCatherine to be contented when he went away. Before they parted,\\nhowever, it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon\\nas possible; and, setting aside the misery of his quitting their box,\\nshe was, upon the whole, left one of the happiest creatures in the\\nworld.\\n\\nWhile talking to each other, she had observed with some surprise that\\nJohn Thorpe, who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes\\ntogether, was engaged in conversation with General Tilney; and she felt\\nsomething more than surprise when she thought she could perceive herself\\nthe object of their attention and discourse. What could they have to say\\nof her? She feared General Tilney did not like her appearance: she found\\nit was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter, rather\\nthan postpone his own walk a few minutes. \"How came Mr. Thorpe to know\\nyour father?\" was her anxious inquiry, as she pointed them out to her\\ncompanion. He knew nothing about it; but his father, like every military\\nman, had a very large acquaintance.\\n\\nWhen the entertainment was over, Thorpe came to assist them in getting\\nout. Catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry; and, while\\nthey waited in the lobby for a chair, he prevented the inquiry which had\\ntravelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue, by asking, in\\na consequential manner, whether she had seen him talking with General\\nTilney: \"He is a fine old fellow, upon my soul! Stout, active--looks\\nas young as his son. I have a great regard for him, I assure you: a\\ngentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived.\"\\n\\n\"But how came you to know him?\"\\n\\n\"Know him! There are few people much about town that I do not know. I\\nhave met him forever at the Bedford; and I knew his face again today the\\nmoment he came into the billiard-room. One of the best players we have,\\nby the by; and we had a little touch together, though I was almost\\nafraid of him at first: the odds were five to four against me; and, if\\nI had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in\\nthis world--I took his ball exactly--but I could not make you understand\\nit without a table; however, I did beat him. A very fine fellow; as rich\\nas a Jew. I should like to dine with him; I dare say he gives famous\\ndinners. But what do you think we have been talking of? You. Yes, by\\nheavens! And the general thinks you the finest girl in Bath.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Nonsense! How can you say so?\"\\n\\n\"And what do you think I said?\"--lowering his voice--\"well done,\\ngeneral, said I; I am quite of your mind.\"\\n\\nHere Catherine, who was much less gratified by his admiration than by\\nGeneral Tilney's, was not sorry to be called away by Mr. Allen. Thorpe,\\nhowever, would see her to her chair, and, till she entered it, continued\\nthe same kind of delicate flattery, in spite of her entreating him to\\nhave done.\\n\\nThat General Tilney, instead of disliking, should admire her, was very\\ndelightful; and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the\\nfamily whom she need now fear to meet. The evening had done more, much\\nmore, for her than could have been expected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\n\\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have now\\npassed in review before the reader; the events of each day, its hopes\\nand fears, mortifications and pleasures, have been separately stated,\\nand the pangs of Sunday only now remain to be described, and close the\\nweek. The Clifton scheme had been deferred, not relinquished, and on\\nthe afternoon's Crescent of this day, it was brought forward again. In a\\nprivate consultation between Isabella and James, the former of whom had\\nparticularly set her heart upon going, and the latter no less anxiously\\nplaced his upon pleasing her, it was agreed that, provided the weather\\nwere fair, the party should take place on the following morning; and\\nthey were to set off very early, in order to be at home in good time.\\nThe affair thus determined, and Thorpe's approbation secured, Catherine\\nonly remained to be apprised of it. She had left them for a few minutes\\nto speak to Miss Tilney. In that interval the plan was completed, and as\\nsoon as she came again, her agreement was demanded; but instead of the\\ngay acquiescence expected by Isabella, Catherine looked grave, was very\\nsorry, but could not go. The engagement which ought to have kept her\\nfrom joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for her to\\naccompany them now. She had that moment settled with Miss Tilney to take\\ntheir proposed walk tomorrow; it was quite determined, and she would\\nnot, upon any account, retract. But that she must and should retract\\nwas instantly the eager cry of both the Thorpes; they must go to Clifton\\ntomorrow, they would not go without her, it would be nothing to put off\\na mere walk for one day longer, and they would not hear of a refusal.\\nCatherine was distressed, but not subdued. \"Do not urge me, Isabella. I\\nam engaged to Miss Tilney. I cannot go.\" This availed nothing. The same\\narguments assailed her again; she must go, she should go, and they would\\nnot hear of a refusal. \"It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you\\nhad just been reminded of a prior engagement, and must only beg to put\\noff the walk till Tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"No, it would not be easy. I could not do it. There has been no prior\\nengagement.\" But Isabella became only more and more urgent, calling\\non her in the most affectionate manner, addressing her by the most\\nendearing names. She was sure her dearest, sweetest Catherine would not\\nseriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so\\ndearly. She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart, so\\nsweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those she loved. But all\\nin vain; Catherine felt herself to be in the right, and though pained\\nby such tender, such flattering supplication, could not allow it to\\ninfluence her. Isabella then tried another method. She reproached her\\nwith having more affection for Miss Tilney, though she had known her so\\nlittle a while, than for her best and oldest friends, with being grown\\ncold and indifferent, in short, towards herself. \"I cannot help being\\njealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who\\nlove you so excessively! When once my affections are placed, it is not\\nin the power of anything to change them. But I believe my feelings are\\nstronger than anybody's; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace;\\nand to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me\\nto the quick, I own. These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else.\"\\n\\nCatherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind. Was it the\\npart of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others?\\nIsabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish, regardless of\\neverything but her own gratification. These painful ideas crossed her\\nmind, though she said nothing. Isabella, in the meanwhile, had applied\\nher handkerchief to her eyes; and Morland, miserable at such a sight,\\ncould not help saying, \"Nay, Catherine. I think you cannot stand out any\\nlonger now. The sacrifice is not much; and to oblige such a friend--I\\nshall think you quite unkind, if you still refuse.\"\\n\\nThis was the first time of her brother's openly siding against her, and\\nanxious to avoid his displeasure, she proposed a compromise. If they\\nwould only put off their scheme till Tuesday, which they might easily\\ndo, as it depended only on themselves, she could go with them, and\\neverybody might then be satisfied. But \"No, no, no!\" was the immediate\\nanswer; \"that could not be, for Thorpe did not know that he might not\\ngo to town on Tuesday.\" Catherine was sorry, but could do no more; and\\na short silence ensued, which was broken by Isabella, who in a voice of\\ncold resentment said, \"Very well, then there is an end of the party.\\nIf Catherine does not go, I cannot. I cannot be the only woman. I would\\nnot, upon any account in the world, do so improper a thing.\"\\n\\n\"Catherine, you must go,\" said James.\\n\\n\"But why cannot Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters? I dare say\\neither of them would like to go.\"\\n\\n\"Thank ye,\" cried Thorpe, \"but I did not come to Bath to drive my\\nsisters about, and look like a fool. No, if you do not go, d---- me if I\\ndo. I only go for the sake of driving you.\"\\n\\n\"That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure.\" But her words were\\nlost on Thorpe, who had turned abruptly away.\\n\\nThe three others still continued together, walking in a most\\nuncomfortable manner to poor Catherine; sometimes not a word was said,\\nsometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches, and\\nher arm was still linked within Isabella's, though their hearts were\\nat war. At one moment she was softened, at another irritated; always\\ndistressed, but always steady.\\n\\n\"I did not think you had been so obstinate, Catherine,\" said James;\\n\"you were not used to be so hard to persuade; you once were the kindest,\\nbest-tempered of my sisters.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I am not less so now,\" she replied, very feelingly; \"but indeed\\nI cannot go. If I am wrong, I am doing what I believe to be right.\"\\n\\n\"I suspect,\" said Isabella, in a low voice, \"there is no great\\nstruggle.\"\\n\\nCatherine's heart swelled; she drew away her arm, and Isabella made no\\nopposition. Thus passed a long ten minutes, till they were again joined\\nby Thorpe, who, coming to them with a gayer look, said, \"Well, I\\nhave settled the matter, and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe\\nconscience. I have been to Miss Tilney, and made your excuses.\"\\n\\n\"You have not!\" cried Catherine.\\n\\n\"I have, upon my soul. Left her this moment. Told her you had sent me to\\nsay that, having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton\\nwith us tomorrow, you could not have the pleasure of walking with her\\ntill Tuesday. She said very well, Tuesday was just as convenient to her;\\nso there is an end of all our difficulties. A pretty good thought of\\nmine--hey?\"\\n\\nIsabella's countenance was once more all smiles and good humour, and\\nJames too looked happy again.\\n\\n\"A most heavenly thought indeed! Now, my sweet Catherine, all our\\ndistresses are over; you are honourably acquitted, and we shall have a\\nmost delightful party.\"\\n\\n\"This will not do,\" said Catherine; \"I cannot submit to this. I must run\\nafter Miss Tilney directly and set her right.\"\\n\\nIsabella, however, caught hold of one hand, Thorpe of the other, and\\nremonstrances poured in from all three. Even James was quite angry. When\\neverything was settled, when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday would\\nsuit her as well, it was quite ridiculous, quite absurd, to make any\\nfurther objection.\\n\\n\"I do not care. Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message.\\nIf I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to Miss\\nTilney myself. This is only doing it in a ruder way; and how do I know\\nthat Mr. Thorpe has--He may be mistaken again perhaps; he led me into\\none act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday. Let me go, Mr. Thorpe;\\nIsabella, do not hold me.\"\\n\\nThorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys; they were\\nturning the corner into Brock Street, when he had overtaken them, and\\nwere at home by this time.\\n\\n\"Then I will go after them,\" said Catherine; \"wherever they are I will\\ngo after them. It does not signify talking. If I could not be persuaded\\ninto doing what I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it.\"\\nAnd with these words she broke away and hurried off. Thorpe would have\\ndarted after her, but Morland withheld him. \"Let her go, let her go, if\\nshe will go.\"\\n\\n\"She is as obstinate as--\"\\n\\nThorpe never finished the simile, for it could hardly have been a proper\\none.\\n\\nAway walked Catherine in great agitation, as fast as the crowd would\\npermit her, fearful of being pursued, yet determined to persevere. As\\nshe walked, she reflected on what had passed. It was painful to her to\\ndisappoint and displease them, particularly to displease her brother;\\nbut she could not repent her resistance. Setting her own inclination\\napart, to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney, to\\nhave retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before,\\nand on a false pretence too, must have been wrong. She had not been\\nwithstanding them on selfish principles alone, she had not consulted\\nmerely her own gratification; that might have been ensured in some\\ndegree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, she had\\nattended to what was due to others, and to her own character in their\\nopinion. Her conviction of being right, however, was not enough to\\nrestore her composure; till she had spoken to Miss Tilney she could not\\nbe at ease; and quickening her pace when she got clear of the Crescent,\\nshe almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of\\nMilsom Street. So rapid had been her movements that in spite of the\\nTilneys' advantage in the outset, they were but just turning into\\ntheir lodgings as she came within view of them; and the servant still\\nremaining at the open door, she used only the ceremony of saying\\nthat she must speak with Miss Tilney that moment, and hurrying by him\\nproceeded upstairs. Then, opening the first door before her, which\\nhappened to be the right, she immediately found herself in the\\ndrawing-room with General Tilney, his son, and daughter. Her\\nexplanation, defective only in being--from her irritation of nerves and\\nshortness of breath--no explanation at all, was instantly given. \"I am\\ncome in a great hurry--It was all a mistake--I never promised to go--I\\ntold them from the first I could not go.--I ran away in a great hurry\\nto explain it.--I did not care what you thought of me.--I would not stay\\nfor the servant.\"\\n\\nThe business, however, though not perfectly elucidated by this speech,\\nsoon ceased to be a puzzle. Catherine found that John Thorpe had given\\nthe message; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly\\nsurprised by it. But whether her brother had still exceeded her in\\nresentment, Catherine, though she instinctively addressed herself as\\nmuch to one as to the other in her vindication, had no means of knowing.\\nWhatever might have been felt before her arrival, her eager declarations\\nimmediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could\\ndesire.\\n\\nThe affair thus happily settled, she was introduced by Miss Tilney\\nto her father, and received by him with such ready, such solicitous\\npoliteness as recalled Thorpe's information to her mind, and made her\\nthink with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on. To such\\nanxious attention was the general's civility carried, that not aware of\\nher extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, he was quite angry\\nwith the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the\\napartment herself. \"What did William mean by it? He should make a point\\nof inquiring into the matter.\" And if Catherine had not most warmly\\nasserted his innocence, it seemed likely that William would lose the\\nfavour of his master forever, if not his place, by her rapidity.\\n\\nAfter sitting with them a quarter of an hour, she rose to take leave,\\nand was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney's asking her if\\nshe would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest\\nof the day with her. Miss Tilney added her own wishes. Catherine was\\ngreatly obliged; but it was quite out of her power. Mr. and Mrs. Allen\\nwould expect her back every moment. The general declared he could say no\\nmore; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded; but on\\nsome other day he trusted, when longer notice could be given, they would\\nnot refuse to spare her to her friend. \"Oh, no; Catherine was sure they\\nwould not have the least objection, and she should have great pleasure\\nin coming.\" The general attended her himself to the street-door, saying\\neverything gallant as they went downstairs, admiring the elasticity of\\nher walk, which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing, and\\nmaking her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld, when they\\nparted.\\n\\nCatherine, delighted by all that had passed, proceeded gaily to Pulteney\\nStreet, walking, as she concluded, with great elasticity, though she\\nhad never thought of it before. She reached home without seeing anything\\nmore of the offended party; and now that she had been triumphant\\nthroughout, had carried her point, and was secure of her walk, she began\\n(as the flutter of her spirits subsided) to doubt whether she had been\\nperfectly right. A sacrifice was always noble; and if she had given way\\nto their entreaties, she should have been spared the distressing idea of\\na friend displeased, a brother angry, and a scheme of great happiness\\nto both destroyed, perhaps through her means. To ease her mind, and\\nascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct\\nhad really been, she took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the\\nhalf-settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the following\\nday. Mr. Allen caught at it directly. \"Well,\" said he, \"and do you think\\nof going too?\"\\n\\n\"No; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told\\nme of it; and therefore you know I could not go with them, could I?\"\\n\\n\"No, certainly not; and I am glad you do not think of it. These schemes\\nare not at all the thing. Young men and women driving about the country\\nin open carriages! Now and then it is very well; but going to inns and\\npublic places together! It is not right; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should\\nallow it. I am glad you do not think of going; I am sure Mrs. Morland\\nwould not be pleased. Mrs. Allen, are not you of my way of thinking? Do\\nnot you think these kind of projects objectionable?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very much so indeed. Open carriages are nasty things. A clean\\ngown is not five minutes' wear in them. You are splashed getting in\\nand getting out; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every\\ndirection. I hate an open carriage myself.\"\\n\\n\"I know you do; but that is not the question. Do not you think it has an\\nodd appearance, if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by\\nyoung men, to whom they are not even related?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear, a very odd appearance indeed. I cannot bear to see it.\"\\n\\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Catherine, \"then why did not you tell me so before?\\nI am sure if I had known it to be improper, I would not have gone with\\nMr. Thorpe at all; but I always hoped you would tell me, if you thought\\nI was doing wrong.\"\\n\\n\"And so I should, my dear, you may depend on it; for as I told Mrs.\\nMorland at parting, I would always do the best for you in my power. But\\none must not be over particular. Young people will be young people,\\nas your good mother says herself. You know I wanted you, when we first\\ncame, not to buy that sprigged muslin, but you would. Young people do\\nnot like to be always thwarted.\"\\n\\n\"But this was something of real consequence; and I do not think you\\nwould have found me hard to persuade.\"\\n\\n\"As far as it has gone hitherto, there is no harm done,\" said Mr. Allen;\\n\"and I would only advise you, my dear, not to go out with Mr. Thorpe any\\nmore.\"\\n\\n\"That is just what I was going to say,\" added his wife.\\n\\nCatherine, relieved for herself, felt uneasy for Isabella, and after a\\nmoment's thought, asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper\\nand kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe, and explain the indecorum of\\nwhich she must be as insensible as herself; for she considered that\\nIsabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day, in\\nspite of what had passed. Mr. Allen, however, discouraged her from doing\\nany such thing. \"You had better leave her alone, my dear; she is old\\nenough to know what she is about, and if not, has a mother to advise\\nher. Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt; but, however, you had\\nbetter not interfere. She and your brother choose to go, and you will be\\nonly getting ill will.\"\\n\\nCatherine submitted, and though sorry to think that Isabella should be\\ndoing wrong, felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen's approbation of her\\nown conduct, and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the\\ndanger of falling into such an error herself. Her escape from being one\\nof the party to Clifton was now an escape indeed; for what would the\\nTilneys have thought of her, if she had broken her promise to them in\\norder to do what was wrong in itself, if she had been guilty of one\\nbreach of propriety, only to enable her to be guilty of another?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\n\\nThe next morning was fair, and Catherine almost expected another attack\\nfrom the assembled party. With Mr. Allen to support her, she felt no\\ndread of the event: but she would gladly be spared a contest, where\\nvictory itself was painful, and was heartily rejoiced therefore at\\nneither seeing nor hearing anything of them. The Tilneys called for\\nher at the appointed time; and no new difficulty arising, no sudden\\nrecollection, no unexpected summons, no impertinent intrusion to\\ndisconcert their measures, my heroine was most unnaturally able to\\nfulfil her engagement, though it was made with the hero himself.\\nThey determined on walking round Beechen Cliff, that noble hill whose\\nbeautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object\\nfrom almost every opening in Bath.\\n\\n\"I never look at it,\" said Catherine, as they walked along the side of\\nthe river, \"without thinking of the south of France.\"\\n\\n\"You have been abroad then?\" said Henry, a little surprised.\\n\\n\"Oh! No, I only mean what I have read about. It always puts me in mind\\nof the country that Emily and her father travelled through, in The\\nMysteries of Udolpho. But you never read novels, I dare say?\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"Because they are not clever enough for you--gentlemen read better\\nbooks.\"\\n\\n\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good\\nnovel, must be intolerably stupid. I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe's\\nworks, and most of them with great pleasure. The Mysteries of Udolpho,\\nwhen I had once begun it, I could not lay down again; I remember\\nfinishing it in two days--my hair standing on end the whole time.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" added Miss Tilney, \"and I remember that you undertook to read it\\naloud to me, and that when I was called away for only five minutes to\\nanswer a note, instead of waiting for me, you took the volume into the\\nHermitage Walk, and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Eleanor--a most honourable testimony. You see, Miss Morland,\\nthe injustice of your suspicions. Here was I, in my eagerness to get on,\\nrefusing to wait only five minutes for my sister, breaking the promise\\nI had made of reading it aloud, and keeping her in suspense at a most\\ninteresting part, by running away with the volume, which, you are to\\nobserve, was her own, particularly her own. I am proud when I reflect on\\nit, and I think it must establish me in your good opinion.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad to hear it indeed, and now I shall never be ashamed of\\nliking Udolpho myself. But I really thought before, young men despised\\nnovels amazingly.\"\\n\\n\"It is amazingly; it may well suggest amazement if they do--for they\\nread nearly as many as women. I myself have read hundreds and hundreds.\\nDo not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias and\\nLouisas. If we proceed to particulars, and engage in the never-ceasing\\ninquiry of 'Have you read this?' and 'Have you read that?' I shall soon\\nleave you as far behind me as--what shall I say?--I want an appropriate\\nsimile.--as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when\\nshe went with her aunt into Italy. Consider how many years I have had\\nthe start of you. I had entered on my studies at Oxford, while you were\\na good little girl working your sampler at home!\"\\n\\n\"Not very good, I am afraid. But now really, do not you think Udolpho\\nthe nicest book in the world?\"\\n\\n\"The nicest--by which I suppose you mean the neatest. That must depend\\nupon the binding.\"\\n\\n\"Henry,\" said Miss Tilney, \"you are very impertinent. Miss Morland, he\\nis treating you exactly as he does his sister. He is forever finding\\nfault with me, for some incorrectness of language, and now he is taking\\nthe same liberty with you. The word 'nicest,' as you used it, did not\\nsuit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or we shall\\nbe overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" cried Catherine, \"I did not mean to say anything wrong; but\\nit is a nice book, and why should not I call it so?\"\\n\\n\"Very true,\" said Henry, \"and this is a very nice day, and we are taking\\na very nice walk, and you are two very nice young ladies. Oh! It is a\\nvery nice word indeed! It does for everything. Originally perhaps it\\nwas applied only to express neatness, propriety, delicacy, or\\nrefinement--people were nice in their dress, in their sentiments, or\\ntheir choice. But now every commendation on every subject is comprised\\nin that one word.\"\\n\\n\"While, in fact,\" cried his sister, \"it ought only to be applied to you,\\nwithout any commendation at all. You are more nice than wise. Come,\\nMiss Morland, let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost\\npropriety of diction, while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms we\\nlike best. It is a most interesting work. You are fond of that kind of\\nreading?\"\\n\\n\"To say the truth, I do not much like any other.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\"\\n\\n\"That is, I can read poetry and plays, and things of that sort, and\\ndo not dislike travels. But history, real solemn history, I cannot be\\ninterested in. Can you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I am fond of history.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I were too. I read it a little as a duty, but it tells me\\nnothing that does not either vex or weary me. The quarrels of popes and\\nkings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good for\\nnothing, and hardly any women at all--it is very tiresome: and yet I\\noften think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great deal of it\\nmust be invention. The speeches that are put into the heroes' mouths,\\ntheir thoughts and designs--the chief of all this must be invention, and\\ninvention is what delights me in other books.\"\\n\\n\"Historians, you think,\" said Miss Tilney, \"are not happy in their\\nflights of fancy. They display imagination without raising interest. I\\nam fond of history--and am very well contented to take the false with\\nthe true. In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence\\nin former histories and records, which may be as much depended on,\\nI conclude, as anything that does not actually pass under one's own\\nobservation; and as for the little embellishments you speak of, they are\\nembellishments, and I like them as such. If a speech be well drawn up,\\nI read it with pleasure, by whomsoever it may be made--and probably with\\nmuch greater, if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson, than if\\nthe genuine words of Caractacus, Agricola, or Alfred the Great.\"\\n\\n\"You are fond of history! And so are Mr. Allen and my father; and I have\\ntwo brothers who do not dislike it. So many instances within my small\\ncircle of friends is remarkable! At this rate, I shall not pity the\\nwriters of history any longer. If people like to read their books, it\\nis all very well, but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes,\\nwhich, as I used to think, nobody would willingly ever look into, to be\\nlabouring only for the torment of little boys and girls, always struck\\nme as a hard fate; and though I know it is all very right and necessary,\\nI have often wondered at the person's courage that could sit down on\\npurpose to do it.\"\\n\\n\"That little boys and girls should be tormented,\" said Henry, \"is what\\nno one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can\\ndeny; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians, I must observe\\nthat they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher\\naim, and that by their method and style, they are perfectly well\\nqualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature\\ntime of life. I use the verb 'to torment,' as I observed to be your own\\nmethod, instead of 'to instruct,' supposing them to be now admitted as\\nsynonymous.\"\\n\\n\"You think me foolish to call instruction a torment, but if you had been\\nas much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their\\nletters and then learning to spell, if you had ever seen how stupid they\\ncan be for a whole morning together, and how tired my poor mother is\\nat the end of it, as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my\\nlife at home, you would allow that 'to torment' and 'to instruct' might\\nsometimes be used as synonymous words.\"\\n\\n\"Very probably. But historians are not accountable for the difficulty\\nof learning to read; and even you yourself, who do not altogether seem\\nparticularly friendly to very severe, very intense application, may\\nperhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth-while to\\nbe tormented for two or three years of one's life, for the sake of\\nbeing able to read all the rest of it. Consider--if reading had not been\\ntaught, Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain--or perhaps might not\\nhave written at all.\"\\n\\nCatherine assented--and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady's\\nmerits closed the subject. The Tilneys were soon engaged in another on\\nwhich she had nothing to say. They were viewing the country with the\\neyes of persons accustomed to drawing, and decided on its capability of\\nbeing formed into pictures, with all the eagerness of real taste. Here\\nCatherine was quite lost. She knew nothing of drawing--nothing of taste:\\nand she listened to them with an attention which brought her little\\nprofit, for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea\\nto her. The little which she could understand, however, appeared to\\ncontradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matter\\nbefore. It seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the\\ntop of an high hill, and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof\\nof a fine day. She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance. A misplaced\\nshame. Where people wish to attach, they should always be ignorant.\\nTo come with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability of\\nadministering to the vanity of others, which a sensible person would\\nalways wish to avoid. A woman especially, if she have the misfortune of\\nknowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can.\\n\\nThe advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already\\nset forth by the capital pen of a sister author; and to her treatment\\nof the subject I will only add, in justice to men, that though to the\\nlarger and more trifling part of the sex, imbecility in females is a\\ngreat enhancement of their personal charms, there is a portion of them\\ntoo reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anything\\nmore in woman than ignorance. But Catherine did not know her own\\nadvantages--did not know that a good-looking girl, with an affectionate\\nheart and a very ignorant mind, cannot fail of attracting a clever young\\nman, unless circumstances are particularly untoward. In the present\\ninstance, she confessed and lamented her want of knowledge, declared\\nthat she would give anything in the world to be able to draw; and\\na lecture on the picturesque immediately followed, in which his\\ninstructions were so clear that she soon began to see beauty in\\neverything admired by him, and her attention was so earnest that he\\nbecame perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste.\\nHe talked of foregrounds, distances, and second distances--side-screens\\nand perspectives--lights and shades; and Catherine was so hopeful a\\nscholar that when they gained the top of Beechen Cliff, she voluntarily\\nrejected the whole city of Bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape.\\nDelighted with her progress, and fearful of wearying her with too much\\nwisdom at once, Henry suffered the subject to decline, and by an easy\\ntransition from a piece of rocky fragment and the withered oak which\\nhe had placed near its summit, to oaks in general, to forests, the\\nenclosure of them, waste lands, crown lands and government, he shortly\\nfound himself arrived at politics; and from politics, it was an\\neasy step to silence. The general pause which succeeded his short\\ndisquisition on the state of the nation was put an end to by Catherine,\\nwho, in rather a solemn tone of voice, uttered these words, \"I have\\nheard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London.\"\\n\\nMiss Tilney, to whom this was chiefly addressed, was startled, and\\nhastily replied, \"Indeed! And of what nature?\"\\n\\n\"That I do not know, nor who is the author. I have only heard that it is\\nto be more horrible than anything we have met with yet.\"\\n\\n\"Good heaven! Where could you hear of such a thing?\"\\n\\n\"A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from\\nLondon yesterday. It is to be uncommonly dreadful. I shall expect murder\\nand everything of the kind.\"\\n\\n\"You speak with astonishing composure! But I hope your friend's accounts\\nhave been exaggerated; and if such a design is known beforehand, proper\\nmeasures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming\\nto effect.\"\\n\\n\"Government,\" said Henry, endeavouring not to smile, \"neither desires\\nnor dares to interfere in such matters. There must be murder; and\\ngovernment cares not how much.\"\\n\\nThe ladies stared. He laughed, and added, \"Come, shall I make you\\nunderstand each other, or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as\\nyou can? No--I will be noble. I will prove myself a man, no less by the\\ngenerosity of my soul than the clearness of my head. I have no patience\\nwith such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the\\ncomprehension of yours. Perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound\\nnor acute--neither vigorous nor keen. Perhaps they may want observation,\\ndiscernment, judgment, fire, genius, and wit.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Morland, do not mind what he says; but have the goodness to\\nsatisfy me as to this dreadful riot.\"\\n\\n\"Riot! What riot?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Eleanor, the riot is only in your own brain. The confusion\\nthere is scandalous. Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more\\ndreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out, in three\\nduodecimo volumes, two hundred and seventy-six pages in each, with\\na frontispiece to the first, of two tombstones and a lantern--do you\\nunderstand? And you, Miss Morland--my stupid sister has mistaken all\\nyour clearest expressions. You talked of expected horrors in London--and\\ninstead of instantly conceiving, as any rational creature would have\\ndone, that such words could relate only to a circulating library, she\\nimmediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling\\nin St. George's Fields, the Bank attacked, the Tower threatened, the\\nstreets of London flowing with blood, a detachment of the Twelfth Light\\nDragoons (the hopes of the nation) called up from Northampton to quell\\nthe insurgents, and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney, in the\\nmoment of charging at the head of his troop, knocked off his horse by a\\nbrickbat from an upper window. Forgive her stupidity. The fears of the\\nsister have added to the weakness of the woman; but she is by no means a\\nsimpleton in general.\"\\n\\nCatherine looked grave. \"And now, Henry,\" said Miss Tilney, \"that you\\nhave made us understand each other, you may as well make Miss Morland\\nunderstand yourself--unless you mean to have her think you intolerably\\nrude to your sister, and a great brute in your opinion of women in\\ngeneral. Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them.\"\\n\\n\"No doubt; but that is no explanation of the present.\"\\n\\n\"What am I to do?\"\\n\\n\"You know what you ought to do. Clear your character handsomely before\\nher. Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Morland, I think very highly of the understanding of all the women\\nin the world--especially of those--whoever they may be--with whom I\\nhappen to be in company.\"\\n\\n\"That is not enough. Be more serious.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Morland, no one can think more highly of the understanding of\\nwomen than I do. In my opinion, nature has given them so much that they\\nnever find it necessary to use more than half.\"\\n\\n\"We shall get nothing more serious from him now, Miss Morland. He is\\nnot in a sober mood. But I do assure you that he must be entirely\\nmisunderstood, if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman\\nat all, or an unkind one of me.\"\\n\\nIt was no effort to Catherine to believe that Henry Tilney could never\\nbe wrong. His manner might sometimes surprise, but his meaning must\\nalways be just: and what she did not understand, she was almost as ready\\nto admire, as what she did. The whole walk was delightful, and though it\\nended too soon, its conclusion was delightful too; her friends attended\\nher into the house, and Miss Tilney, before they parted, addressing\\nherself with respectful form, as much to Mrs. Allen as to Catherine,\\npetitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day after\\nthe next. No difficulty was made on Mrs. Allen's side, and the only\\ndifficulty on Catherine's was in concealing the excess of her pleasure.\\n\\nThe morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all her\\nfriendship and natural affection, for no thought of Isabella or James\\nhad crossed her during their walk. When the Tilneys were gone, she\\nbecame amiable again, but she was amiable for some time to little\\neffect; Mrs. Allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her\\nanxiety; she had heard nothing of any of them. Towards the end of the\\nmorning, however, Catherine, having occasion for some indispensable yard\\nof ribbon which must be bought without a moment's delay, walked out into\\nthe town, and in Bond Street overtook the second Miss Thorpe as she was\\nloitering towards Edgar's Buildings between two of the sweetest girls in\\nthe world, who had been her dear friends all the morning. From her, she\\nsoon learned that the party to Clifton had taken place. \"They set off at\\neight this morning,\" said Miss Anne, \"and I am sure I do not envy\\nthem their drive. I think you and I are very well off to be out of the\\nscrape. It must be the dullest thing in the world, for there is not a\\nsoul at Clifton at this time of year. Belle went with your brother, and\\nJohn drove Maria.\"\\n\\nCatherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing this part of the\\narrangement.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes,\" rejoined the other, \"Maria is gone. She was quite wild to go.\\nShe thought it would be something very fine. I cannot say I admire her\\ntaste; and for my part, I was determined from the first not to go, if\\nthey pressed me ever so much.\"\\n\\nCatherine, a little doubtful of this, could not help answering, \"I wish\\nyou could have gone too. It is a pity you could not all go.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me. Indeed, I\\nwould not have gone on any account. I was saying so to Emily and Sophia\\nwhen you overtook us.\"\\n\\nCatherine was still unconvinced; but glad that Anne should have the\\nfriendship of an Emily and a Sophia to console her, she bade her adieu\\nwithout much uneasiness, and returned home, pleased that the party had\\nnot been prevented by her refusing to join it, and very heartily wishing\\nthat it might be too pleasant to allow either James or Isabella to\\nresent her resistance any longer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15\\n\\n\\nEarly the next day, a note from Isabella, speaking peace and tenderness\\nin every line, and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on\\na matter of the utmost importance, hastened Catherine, in the happiest\\nstate of confidence and curiosity, to Edgar's Buildings. The two\\nyoungest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour; and, on Anne's\\nquitting it to call her sister, Catherine took the opportunity of asking\\nthe other for some particulars of their yesterday's party. Maria desired\\nno greater pleasure than to speak of it; and Catherine immediately\\nlearnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the\\nworld, that nobody could imagine how charming it had been, and that\\nit had been more delightful than anybody could conceive. Such was the\\ninformation of the first five minutes; the second unfolded thus much in\\ndetail--that they had driven directly to the York Hotel, ate some soup,\\nand bespoke an early dinner, walked down to the pump-room, tasted the\\nwater, and laid out some shillings in purses and spars; thence adjourned\\nto eat ice at a pastry-cook's, and hurrying back to the hotel, swallowed\\ntheir dinner in haste, to prevent being in the dark; and then had a\\ndelightful drive back, only the moon was not up, and it rained a little,\\nand Mr. Morland's horse was so tired he could hardly get it along.\\n\\nCatherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction. It appeared that Blaize\\nCastle had never been thought of; and, as for all the rest, there was\\nnothing to regret for half an instant. Maria's intelligence concluded\\nwith a tender effusion of pity for her sister Anne, whom she represented\\nas insupportably cross, from being excluded the party.\\n\\n\"She will never forgive me, I am sure; but, you know, how could I help\\nit? John would have me go, for he vowed he would not drive her, because\\nshe had such thick ankles. I dare say she will not be in good humour\\nagain this month; but I am determined I will not be cross; it is not a\\nlittle matter that puts me out of temper.\"\\n\\nIsabella now entered the room with so eager a step, and a look of such\\nhappy importance, as engaged all her friend's notice. Maria was without\\nceremony sent away, and Isabella, embracing Catherine, thus began: \"Yes,\\nmy dear Catherine, it is so indeed; your penetration has not deceived\\nyou. Oh! That arch eye of yours! It sees through everything.\"\\n\\nCatherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance.\\n\\n\"Nay, my beloved, sweetest friend,\" continued the other, \"compose\\nyourself. I am amazingly agitated, as you perceive. Let us sit down and\\ntalk in comfort. Well, and so you guessed it the moment you had my note?\\nSly creature! Oh! My dear Catherine, you alone, who know my heart, can\\njudge of my present happiness. Your brother is the most charming of\\nmen. I only wish I were more worthy of him. But what will your excellent\\nfather and mother say? Oh! Heavens! When I think of them I am so\\nagitated!\"\\n\\nCatherine's understanding began to awake: an idea of the truth suddenly\\ndarted into her mind; and, with the natural blush of so new an emotion,\\nshe cried out, \"Good heaven! My dear Isabella, what do you mean? Can\\nyou--can you really be in love with James?\"\\n\\nThis bold surmise, however, she soon learnt comprehended but half the\\nfact. The anxious affection, which she was accused of having continually\\nwatched in Isabella's every look and action, had, in the course of their\\nyesterday's party, received the delightful confession of an equal love.\\nHer heart and faith were alike engaged to James. Never had Catherine\\nlistened to anything so full of interest, wonder, and joy. Her brother\\nand her friend engaged! New to such circumstances, the importance of\\nit appeared unspeakably great, and she contemplated it as one of those\\ngrand events, of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a\\nreturn. The strength of her feelings she could not express; the nature\\nof them, however, contented her friend. The happiness of having such a\\nsister was their first effusion, and the fair ladies mingled in embraces\\nand tears of joy.\\n\\nDelighting, however, as Catherine sincerely did in the prospect of the\\nconnection, it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her\\nin tender anticipations. \"You will be so infinitely dearer to me, my\\nCatherine, than either Anne or Maria: I feel that I shall be so much\\nmore attached to my dear Morland's family than to my own.\"\\n\\nThis was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine.\\n\\n\"You are so like your dear brother,\" continued Isabella, \"that I quite\\ndoted on you the first moment I saw you. But so it always is with me;\\nthe first moment settles everything. The very first day that Morland\\ncame to us last Christmas--the very first moment I beheld him--my heart\\nwas irrecoverably gone. I remember I wore my yellow gown, with my hair\\ndone up in braids; and when I came into the drawing-room, and John\\nintroduced him, I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before.\"\\n\\nHere Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love; for, though\\nexceedingly fond of her brother, and partial to all his endowments, she\\nhad never in her life thought him handsome.\\n\\n\"I remember too, Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening, and wore\\nher puce-coloured sarsenet; and she looked so heavenly that I thought\\nyour brother must certainly fall in love with her; I could not sleep\\na wink all right for thinking of it. Oh! Catherine, the many sleepless\\nnights I have had on your brother's account! I would not have you suffer\\nhalf what I have done! I am grown wretchedly thin, I know; but I will\\nnot pain you by describing my anxiety; you have seen enough of it. I\\nfeel that I have betrayed myself perpetually--so unguarded in speaking\\nof my partiality for the church! But my secret I was always sure would\\nbe safe with you.\"\\n\\nCatherine felt that nothing could have been safer; but ashamed of an\\nignorance little expected, she dared no longer contest the point,\\nnor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate\\nsympathy as Isabella chose to consider her. Her brother, she found,\\nwas preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton, to make known his\\nsituation and ask consent; and here was a source of some real agitation\\nto the mind of Isabella. Catherine endeavoured to persuade her, as she\\nwas herself persuaded, that her father and mother would never oppose\\ntheir son's wishes. \"It is impossible,\" said she, \"for parents to be\\nmore kind, or more desirous of their children's happiness; I have no\\ndoubt of their consenting immediately.\"\\n\\n\"Morland says exactly the same,\" replied Isabella; \"and yet I dare not\\nexpect it; my fortune will be so small; they never can consent to it.\\nYour brother, who might marry anybody!\"\\n\\nHere Catherine again discerned the force of love.\\n\\n\"Indeed, Isabella, you are too humble. The difference of fortune can be\\nnothing to signify.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! My sweet Catherine, in your generous heart I know it would signify\\nnothing; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many. As for\\nmyself, I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed. Had I the\\ncommand of millions, were I mistress of the whole world, your brother\\nwould be my only choice.\"\\n\\nThis charming sentiment, recommended as much by sense as novelty,\\ngave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her\\nacquaintance; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than\\nin uttering the grand idea. \"I am sure they will consent,\" was her\\nfrequent declaration; \"I am sure they will be delighted with you.\"\\n\\n\"For my own part,\" said Isabella, \"my wishes are so moderate that the\\nsmallest income in nature would be enough for me. Where people are\\nreally attached, poverty itself is wealth; grandeur I detest: I would\\nnot settle in London for the universe. A cottage in some retired village\\nwould be ecstasy. There are some charming little villas about Richmond.\"\\n\\n\"Richmond!\" cried Catherine. \"You must settle near Fullerton. You must\\nbe near us.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not. If I can but be near you,\\nI shall be satisfied. But this is idle talking! I will not allow myself\\nto think of such things, till we have your father's answer. Morland\\nsays that by sending it tonight to Salisbury, we may have it tomorrow.\\nTomorrow? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter. I know\\nit will be the death of me.\"\\n\\nA reverie succeeded this conviction--and when Isabella spoke again, it\\nwas to resolve on the quality of her wedding-gown.\\n\\nTheir conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself,\\nwho came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for Wiltshire.\\nCatherine wished to congratulate him, but knew not what to say, and her\\neloquence was only in her eyes. From them, however, the eight parts of\\nspeech shone out most expressively, and James could combine them with\\nease. Impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home, his\\nadieus were not long; and they would have been yet shorter, had he not\\nbeen frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one that\\nhe would go. Twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness\\nto have him gone. \"Indeed, Morland, I must drive you away. Consider how\\nfar you have to ride. I cannot bear to see you linger so. For heaven's\\nsake, waste no more time. There, go, go--I insist on it.\"\\n\\nThe two friends, with hearts now more united than ever, were inseparable\\nfor the day; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along.\\nMrs. Thorpe and her son, who were acquainted with everything, and\\nwho seemed only to want Mr. Morland's consent, to consider Isabella's\\nengagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their\\nfamily, were allowed to join their counsels, and add their quota of\\nsignificant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure\\nof curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters. To\\nCatherine's simple feelings, this odd sort of reserve seemed neither\\nkindly meant, nor consistently supported; and its unkindness she would\\nhardly have forborne pointing out, had its inconsistency been less their\\nfriend; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of\\ntheir \"I know what\"; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit,\\na display of family ingenuity, on one side in the mystery of an affected\\nsecret, on the other of undefined discovery, all equally acute.\\n\\nCatherine was with her friend again the next day, endeavouring to\\nsupport her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before\\nthe delivery of the letters; a needful exertion, for as the time\\nof reasonable expectation drew near, Isabella became more and more\\ndesponding, and before the letter arrived, had worked herself into a\\nstate of real distress. But when it did come, where could distress\\nbe found? \"I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind\\nparents, and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to\\nforward my happiness,\" were the first three lines, and in one moment\\nall was joyful security. The brightest glow was instantly spread over\\nIsabella's features, all care and anxiety seemed removed, her spirits\\nbecame almost too high for control, and she called herself without\\nscruple the happiest of mortals.\\n\\nMrs. Thorpe, with tears of joy, embraced her daughter, her son, her\\nvisitor, and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with\\nsatisfaction. Her heart was overflowing with tenderness. It was \"dear\\nJohn\" and \"dear Catherine\" at every word; \"dear Anne and dear Maria\"\\nmust immediately be made sharers in their felicity; and two \"dears\" at\\nonce before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child\\nhad now well earned. John himself was no skulker in joy. He not only\\nbestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the finest\\nfellows in the world, but swore off many sentences in his praise.\\n\\nThe letter, whence sprang all this felicity, was short, containing\\nlittle more than this assurance of success; and every particular was\\ndeferred till James could write again. But for particulars Isabella\\ncould well afford to wait. The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland's\\npromise; his honour was pledged to make everything easy; and by what\\nmeans their income was to be formed, whether landed property were to\\nbe resigned, or funded money made over, was a matter in which her\\ndisinterested spirit took no concern. She knew enough to feel secure of\\nan honourable and speedy establishment, and her imagination took a rapid\\nflight over its attendant felicities. She saw herself at the end of\\na few weeks, the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at\\nFullerton, the envy of every valued old friend in Putney, with a\\ncarriage at her command, a new name on her tickets, and a brilliant\\nexhibition of hoop rings on her finger.\\n\\nWhen the contents of the letter were ascertained, John Thorpe, who had\\nonly waited its arrival to begin his journey to London, prepared to set\\noff. \"Well, Miss Morland,\" said he, on finding her alone in the parlour,\\n\"I am come to bid you good-bye.\" Catherine wished him a good journey.\\nWithout appearing to hear her, he walked to the window, fidgeted about,\\nhummed a tune, and seemed wholly self-occupied.\\n\\n\"Shall not you be late at Devizes?\" said Catherine. He made no answer;\\nbut after a minute's silence burst out with, \"A famous good thing this\\nmarrying scheme, upon my soul! A clever fancy of Morland's and Belle's.\\nWhat do you think of it, Miss Morland? I say it is no bad notion.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I think it a very good one.\"\\n\\n\"Do you? That's honest, by heavens! I am glad you are no enemy to\\nmatrimony, however. Did you ever hear the old song 'Going to One Wedding\\nBrings on Another?' I say, you will come to Belle's wedding, I hope.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I have promised your sister to be with her, if possible.\"\\n\\n\"And then you know\"--twisting himself about and forcing a foolish\\nlaugh--\"I say, then you know, we may try the truth of this same old\\nsong.\"\\n\\n\"May we? But I never sing. Well, I wish you a good journey. I dine with\\nMiss Tilney today, and must now be going home.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, but there is no such confounded hurry. Who knows when we may\\nbe together again? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a\\nfortnight, and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me.\"\\n\\n\"Then why do you stay away so long?\" replied Catherine--finding that he\\nwaited for an answer.\\n\\n\"That is kind of you, however--kind and good-natured. I shall not forget\\nit in a hurry. But you have more good nature and all that, than anybody\\nliving, I believe. A monstrous deal of good nature, and it is not only\\ngood nature, but you have so much, so much of everything; and then you\\nhave such--upon my soul, I do not know anybody like you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, there are a great many people like me, I dare say, only a\\ngreat deal better. Good morning to you.\"\\n\\n\"But I say, Miss Morland, I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton\\nbefore it is long, if not disagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do. My father and mother will be very glad to see you.\"\\n\\n\"And I hope--I hope, Miss Morland, you will not be sorry to see me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, not at all. There are very few people I am sorry to see.\\nCompany is always cheerful.\"\\n\\n\"That is just my way of thinking. Give me but a little cheerful company,\\nlet me only have the company of the people I love, let me only be where\\nI like and with whom I like, and the devil take the rest, say I. And\\nI am heartily glad to hear you say the same. But I have a notion, Miss\\nMorland, you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps we may; but it is more than I ever thought of. And as to most\\nmatters, to say the truth, there are not many that I know my own mind\\nabout.\"\\n\\n\"By Jove, no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what\\ndoes not concern me. My notion of things is simple enough. Let me only\\nhave the girl I like, say I, with a comfortable house over my head, and\\nwhat care I for all the rest? Fortune is nothing. I am sure of a good\\nincome of my own; and if she had not a penny, why, so much the better.\"\\n\\n\"Very true. I think like you there. If there is a good fortune on one\\nside, there can be no occasion for any on the other. No matter which\\nhas it, so that there is enough. I hate the idea of one great fortune\\nlooking out for another. And to marry for money I think the wickedest\\nthing in existence. Good day. We shall be very glad to see you at\\nFullerton, whenever it is convenient.\" And away she went. It was not in\\nthe power of all his gallantry to detain her longer. With such news to\\ncommunicate, and such a visit to prepare for, her departure was not\\nto be delayed by anything in his nature to urge; and she hurried away,\\nleaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address, and\\nher explicit encouragement.\\n\\nThe agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning her\\nbrother's engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion\\nin Mr. and Mrs. Allen, by the communication of the wonderful event. How\\ngreat was her disappointment! The important affair, which many words of\\npreparation ushered in, had been foreseen by them both ever since\\nher brother's arrival; and all that they felt on the occasion was\\ncomprehended in a wish for the young people's happiness, with a remark,\\non the gentleman's side, in favour of Isabella's beauty, and on the\\nlady's, of her great good luck. It was to Catherine the most surprising\\ninsensibility. The disclosure, however, of the great secret of James's\\ngoing to Fullerton the day before, did raise some emotion in Mrs. Allen.\\nShe could not listen to that with perfect calmness, but repeatedly\\nregretted the necessity of its concealment, wished she could have known\\nhis intention, wished she could have seen him before he went, as she\\nshould certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his father\\nand mother, and her kind compliments to all the Skinners.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 16\\n\\n\\nCatherine's expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street\\nwere so very high that disappointment was inevitable; and accordingly,\\nthough she was most politely received by General Tilney, and kindly\\nwelcomed by his daughter, though Henry was at home, and no one else of\\nthe party, she found, on her return, without spending many hours in\\nthe examination of her feelings, that she had gone to her appointment\\npreparing for happiness which it had not afforded. Instead of finding\\nherself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney, from the intercourse\\nof the day, she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before; instead\\nof seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever, in the ease of a\\nfamily party, he had never said so little, nor been so little agreeable;\\nand, in spite of their father's great civilities to her--in spite of his\\nthanks, invitations, and compliments--it had been a release to get\\naway from him. It puzzled her to account for all this. It could not\\nbe General Tilney's fault. That he was perfectly agreeable and\\ngood-natured, and altogether a very charming man, did not admit of a\\ndoubt, for he was tall and handsome, and Henry's father. He could not\\nbe accountable for his children's want of spirits, or for her want of\\nenjoyment in his company. The former she hoped at last might have\\nbeen accidental, and the latter she could only attribute to her own\\nstupidity. Isabella, on hearing the particulars of the visit, gave\\na different explanation: \"It was all pride, pride, insufferable\\nhaughtiness and pride! She had long suspected the family to be very\\nhigh, and this made it certain. Such insolence of behaviour as Miss\\nTilney's she had never heard of in her life! Not to do the honours of\\nher house with common good breeding! To behave to her guest with such\\nsuperciliousness! Hardly even to speak to her!\"\\n\\n\"But it was not so bad as that, Isabella; there was no superciliousness;\\nshe was very civil.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Don't defend her! And then the brother, he, who had appeared\\nso attached to you! Good heavens! Well, some people's feelings are\\nincomprehensible. And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day?\"\\n\\n\"I do not say so; but he did not seem in good spirits.\"\\n\\n\"How contemptible! Of all things in the world inconstancy is my\\naversion. Let me entreat you never to think of him again, my dear\\nCatherine; indeed he is unworthy of you.\"\\n\\n\"Unworthy! I do not suppose he ever thinks of me.\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I say; he never thinks of you. Such fickleness!\\nOh! How different to your brother and to mine! I really believe John has\\nthe most constant heart.\"\\n\\n\"But as for General Tilney, I assure you it would be impossible for\\nanybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention; it seemed\\nto be his only care to entertain and make me happy.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I know no harm of him; I do not suspect him of pride. I believe he\\nis a very gentleman-like man. John thinks very well of him, and John's\\njudgment--\"\\n\\n\"Well, I shall see how they behave to me this evening; we shall meet\\nthem at the rooms.\"\\n\\n\"And must I go?\"\\n\\n\"Do not you intend it? I thought it was all settled.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, since you make such a point of it, I can refuse you nothing. But\\ndo not insist upon my being very agreeable, for my heart, you know, will\\nbe some forty miles off. And as for dancing, do not mention it, I beg;\\nthat is quite out of the question. Charles Hodges will plague me to\\ndeath, I dare say; but I shall cut him very short. Ten to one but he\\nguesses the reason, and that is exactly what I want to avoid, so I shall\\ninsist on his keeping his conjecture to himself.\"\\n\\nIsabella's opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend; she was\\nsure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or\\nsister; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts.\\nThe evening rewarded her confidence; she was met by one with the same\\nkindness, and by the other with the same attention, as heretofore: Miss\\nTilney took pains to be near her, and Henry asked her to dance.\\n\\nHaving heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother,\\nCaptain Tilney, was expected almost every hour, she was at no loss for\\nthe name of a very fashionable-looking, handsome young man, whom she had\\nnever seen before, and who now evidently belonged to their party. She\\nlooked at him with great admiration, and even supposed it possible that\\nsome people might think him handsomer than his brother, though, in her\\neyes, his air was more assuming, and his countenance less prepossessing.\\nHis taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior; for,\\nwithin her hearing, he not only protested against every thought of\\ndancing himself, but even laughed openly at Henry for finding it\\npossible. From the latter circumstance it may be presumed that, whatever\\nmight be our heroine's opinion of him, his admiration of her was not\\nof a very dangerous kind; not likely to produce animosities between the\\nbrothers, nor persecutions to the lady. He cannot be the instigator of\\nthe three villains in horsemen's greatcoats, by whom she will hereafter\\nbe forced into a traveling-chaise and four, which will drive off with\\nincredible speed. Catherine, meanwhile, undisturbed by presentiments of\\nsuch an evil, or of any evil at all, except that of having but a short\\nset to dance down, enjoyed her usual happiness with Henry Tilney,\\nlistening with sparkling eyes to everything he said; and, in finding him\\nirresistible, becoming so herself.\\n\\nAt the end of the first dance, Captain Tilney came towards them again,\\nand, much to Catherine's dissatisfaction, pulled his brother away. They\\nretired whispering together; and, though her delicate sensibility did\\nnot take immediate alarm, and lay it down as fact, that Captain Tilney\\nmust have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her, which he now\\nhastened to communicate to his brother, in the hope of separating them\\nforever, she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight without\\nvery uneasy sensations. Her suspense was of full five minutes' duration;\\nand she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour, when\\nthey both returned, and an explanation was given, by Henry's requesting\\nto know if she thought her friend, Miss Thorpe, would have any objection\\nto dancing, as his brother would be most happy to be introduced to\\nher. Catherine, without hesitation, replied that she was very sure Miss\\nThorpe did not mean to dance at all. The cruel reply was passed on to\\nthe other, and he immediately walked away.\\n\\n\"Your brother will not mind it, I know,\" said she, \"because I heard him\\nsay before that he hated dancing; but it was very good-natured in him\\nto think of it. I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down, and fancied she\\nmight wish for a partner; but he is quite mistaken, for she would not\\ndance upon any account in the world.\"\\n\\nHenry smiled, and said, \"How very little trouble it can give you to\\nunderstand the motive of other people's actions.\"\\n\\n\"Why? What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"With you, it is not, How is such a one likely to be influenced, What\\nis the inducement most likely to act upon such a person's feelings, age,\\nsituation, and probable habits of life considered--but, How should I be\\ninfluenced, What would be my inducement in acting so and so?\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand you.\"\\n\\n\"Then we are on very unequal terms, for I understand you perfectly\\nwell.\"\\n\\n\"Me? Yes; I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.\"\\n\\n\"Bravo! An excellent satire on modern language.\"\\n\\n\"But pray tell me what you mean.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I indeed? Do you really desire it? But you are not aware of the\\nconsequences; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment, and\\ncertainly bring on a disagreement between us.\"\\n\\n\"No, no; it shall not do either; I am not afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, I only meant that your attributing my brother's wish of\\ndancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being\\nsuperior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world.\"\\n\\nCatherine blushed and disclaimed, and the gentleman's predictions were\\nverified. There was a something, however, in his words which repaid her\\nfor the pain of confusion; and that something occupied her mind so much\\nthat she drew back for some time, forgetting to speak or to listen, and\\nalmost forgetting where she was; till, roused by the voice of Isabella,\\nshe looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them\\nhands across.\\n\\nIsabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled, the only explanation of this\\nextraordinary change which could at that time be given; but as it\\nwas not quite enough for Catherine's comprehension, she spoke her\\nastonishment in very plain terms to her partner.\\n\\n\"I cannot think how it could happen! Isabella was so determined not to\\ndance.\"\\n\\n\"And did Isabella never change her mind before?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! But, because--And your brother! After what you told him from me,\\nhow could he think of going to ask her?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot take surprise to myself on that head. You bid me be surprised\\non your friend's account, and therefore I am; but as for my brother, his\\nconduct in the business, I must own, has been no more than I believed\\nhim perfectly equal to. The fairness of your friend was an open\\nattraction; her firmness, you know, could only be understood by\\nyourself.\"\\n\\n\"You are laughing; but, I assure you, Isabella is very firm in general.\"\\n\\n\"It is as much as should be said of anyone. To be always firm must be\\nto be often obstinate. When properly to relax is the trial of judgment;\\nand, without reference to my brother, I really think Miss Thorpe has by\\nno means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour.\"\\n\\nThe friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse\\ntill all the dancing was over; but then, as they walked about the room\\narm in arm, Isabella thus explained herself: \"I do not wonder at your\\nsurprise; and I am really fatigued to death. He is such a rattle!\\nAmusing enough, if my mind had been disengaged; but I would have given\\nthe world to sit still.\"\\n\\n\"Then why did not you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! My dear! It would have looked so particular; and you know how I\\nabhor doing that. I refused him as long as I possibly could, but he\\nwould take no denial. You have no idea how he pressed me. I begged him\\nto excuse me, and get some other partner--but no, not he; after aspiring\\nto my hand, there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of;\\nand it was not that he wanted merely to dance, he wanted to be with\\nme. Oh! Such nonsense! I told him he had taken a very unlikely way to\\nprevail upon me; for, of all things in the world, I hated fine speeches\\nand compliments; and so--and so then I found there would be no peace if\\nI did not stand up. Besides, I thought Mrs. Hughes, who introduced him,\\nmight take it ill if I did not: and your dear brother, I am sure he\\nwould have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening. I am\\nso glad it is over! My spirits are quite jaded with listening to his\\nnonsense: and then, being such a smart young fellow, I saw every eye was\\nupon us.\"\\n\\n\"He is very handsome indeed.\"\\n\\n\"Handsome! Yes, I suppose he may. I dare say people would admire him\\nin general; but he is not at all in my style of beauty. I hate a florid\\ncomplexion and dark eyes in a man. However, he is very well. Amazingly\\nconceited, I am sure. I took him down several times, you know, in my\\nway.\"\\n\\nWhen the young ladies next met, they had a far more interesting subject\\nto discuss. James Morland's second letter was then received, and the\\nkind intentions of his father fully explained. A living, of which Mr.\\nMorland was himself patron and incumbent, of about four hundred pounds\\nyearly value, was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be\\nold enough to take it; no trifling deduction from the family income, no\\nniggardly assignment to one of ten children. An estate of at least equal\\nvalue, moreover, was assured as his future inheritance.\\n\\nJames expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude; and\\nthe necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could\\nmarry, being, however unwelcome, no more than he had expected, was borne\\nby him without discontent. Catherine, whose expectations had been as\\nunfixed as her ideas of her father's income, and whose judgment was now\\nentirely led by her brother, felt equally well satisfied, and heartily\\ncongratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled.\\n\\n\"It is very charming indeed,\" said Isabella, with a grave face. \"Mr.\\nMorland has behaved vastly handsome indeed,\" said the gentle Mrs.\\nThorpe, looking anxiously at her daughter. \"I only wish I could do as\\nmuch. One could not expect more from him, you know. If he finds he\\ncan do more by and by, I dare say he will, for I am sure he must be an\\nexcellent good-hearted man. Four hundred is but a small income to begin\\non indeed, but your wishes, my dear Isabella, are so moderate, you do\\nnot consider how little you ever want, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"It is not on my own account I wish for more; but I cannot bear to\\nbe the means of injuring my dear Morland, making him sit down upon an\\nincome hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life. For\\nmyself, it is nothing; I never think of myself.\"\\n\\n\"I know you never do, my dear; and you will always find your reward in\\nthe affection it makes everybody feel for you. There never was a young\\nwoman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you; and I dare say\\nwhen Mr. Morland sees you, my dear child--but do not let us distress\\nour dear Catherine by talking of such things. Mr. Morland has behaved so\\nvery handsome, you know. I always heard he was a most excellent man;\\nand you know, my dear, we are not to suppose but what, if you had had a\\nsuitable fortune, he would have come down with something more, for I am\\nsure he must be a most liberal-minded man.\"\\n\\n\"Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do, I am sure. But\\neverybody has their failing, you know, and everybody has a right to\\ndo what they like with their own money.\" Catherine was hurt by these\\ninsinuations. \"I am very sure,\" said she, \"that my father has promised\\nto do as much as he can afford.\"\\n\\nIsabella recollected herself. \"As to that, my sweet Catherine, there\\ncannot be a doubt, and you know me well enough to be sure that a much\\nsmaller income would satisfy me. It is not the want of more money that\\nmakes me just at present a little out of spirits; I hate money; and if\\nour union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year, I should\\nnot have a wish unsatisfied. Ah! my Catherine, you have found me out.\\nThere's the sting. The long, long, endless two years and half that are\\nto pass before your brother can hold the living.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, my darling Isabella,\" said Mrs. Thorpe, \"we perfectly see\\ninto your heart. You have no disguise. We perfectly understand the\\npresent vexation; and everybody must love you the better for such a\\nnoble honest affection.\"\\n\\nCatherine's uncomfortable feelings began to lessen. She endeavoured to\\nbelieve that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella's\\nregret; and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and\\namiable as ever, endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought\\notherwise. James soon followed his letter, and was received with the\\nmost gratifying kindness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 17\\n\\n\\nThe Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath; and\\nwhether it should be the last was for some time a question, to which\\nCatherine listened with a beating heart. To have her acquaintance with\\nthe Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance.\\nHer whole happiness seemed at stake, while the affair was in suspense,\\nand everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings should\\nbe taken for another fortnight. What this additional fortnight was to\\nproduce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made\\nbut a small part of Catherine's speculation. Once or twice indeed, since\\nJames's engagement had taught her what could be done, she had got so\\nfar as to indulge in a secret \"perhaps,\" but in general the felicity of\\nbeing with him for the present bounded her views: the present was now\\ncomprised in another three weeks, and her happiness being certain for\\nthat period, the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite\\nbut little interest. In the course of the morning which saw this\\nbusiness arranged, she visited Miss Tilney, and poured forth her\\njoyful feelings. It was doomed to be a day of trial. No sooner had she\\nexpressed her delight in Mr. Allen's lengthened stay than Miss Tilney\\ntold her of her father's having just determined upon quitting Bath\\nby the end of another week. Here was a blow! The past suspense of\\nthe morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment.\\nCatherine's countenance fell, and in a voice of most sincere concern she\\nechoed Miss Tilney's concluding words, \"By the end of another week!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I\\nthink a fair trial. He has been disappointed of some friends' arrival\\nwhom he expected to meet here, and as he is now pretty well, is in a\\nhurry to get home.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sorry for it,\" said Catherine dejectedly; \"if I had known\\nthis before--\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner, \"you would be so\\ngood--it would make me very happy if--\"\\n\\nThe entrance of her father put a stop to the civility, which Catherine\\nwas beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding.\\nAfter addressing her with his usual politeness, he turned to his\\ndaughter and said, \"Well, Eleanor, may I congratulate you on being\\nsuccessful in your application to your fair friend?\"\\n\\n\"I was just beginning to make the request, sir, as you came in.\"\\n\\n\"Well, proceed by all means. I know how much your heart is in it. My\\ndaughter, Miss Morland,\" he continued, without leaving his daughter time\\nto speak, \"has been forming a very bold wish. We leave Bath, as she has\\nperhaps told you, on Saturday se'nnight. A letter from my steward tells\\nme that my presence is wanted at home; and being disappointed in my hope\\nof seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here, some of\\nmy very old friends, there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath. And\\ncould we carry our selfish point with you, we should leave it without a\\nsingle regret. Can you, in short, be prevailed on to quit this scene\\nof public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in\\nGloucestershire? I am almost ashamed to make the request, though its\\npresumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath\\nthan yourself. Modesty such as yours--but not for the world would I pain\\nit by open praise. If you can be induced to honour us with a visit,\\nyou will make us happy beyond expression. 'Tis true, we can offer you\\nnothing like the gaieties of this lively place; we can tempt you neither\\nby amusement nor splendour, for our mode of living, as you see, is plain\\nand unpretending; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make\\nNorthanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable.\"\\n\\nNorthanger Abbey! These were thrilling words, and wound up Catherine's\\nfeelings to the highest point of ecstasy. Her grateful and gratified\\nheart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of\\ntolerable calmness. To receive so flattering an invitation! To have her\\ncompany so warmly solicited! Everything honourable and soothing, every\\npresent enjoyment, and every future hope was contained in it; and her\\nacceptance, with only the saving clause of Papa and Mamma's approbation,\\nwas eagerly given. \"I will write home directly,\" said she, \"and if they\\ndo not object, as I dare say they will not--\"\\n\\nGeneral Tilney was not less sanguine, having already waited on her\\nexcellent friends in Pulteney Street, and obtained their sanction of\\nhis wishes. \"Since they can consent to part with you,\" said he, \"we may\\nexpect philosophy from all the world.\"\\n\\nMiss Tilney was earnest, though gentle, in her secondary civilities, and\\nthe affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary\\nreference to Fullerton would allow.\\n\\nThe circumstances of the morning had led Catherine's feelings through\\nthe varieties of suspense, security, and disappointment; but they were\\nnow safely lodged in perfect bliss; and with spirits elated to rapture,\\nwith Henry at her heart, and Northanger Abbey on her lips, she\\nhurried home to write her letter. Mr. and Mrs. Morland, relying on\\nthe discretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted their\\ndaughter, felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had\\nbeen formed under their eye, and sent therefore by return of post their\\nready consent to her visit in Gloucestershire. This indulgence, though\\nnot more than Catherine had hoped for, completed her conviction of being\\nfavoured beyond every other human creature, in friends and fortune,\\ncircumstance and chance. Everything seemed to cooperate for her\\nadvantage. By the kindness of her first friends, the Allens, she had\\nbeen introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her.\\nHer feelings, her preferences, had each known the happiness of a return.\\nWherever she felt attachment, she had been able to create it. The\\naffection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister. The Tilneys,\\nthey, by whom, above all, she desired to be favourably thought of,\\noutstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which their\\nintimacy was to be continued. She was to be their chosen visitor, she\\nwas to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society\\nshe mostly prized--and, in addition to all the rest, this roof was to\\nbe the roof of an abbey! Her passion for ancient edifices was next in\\ndegree to her passion for Henry Tilney--and castles and abbeys made\\nusually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill. To see\\nand explore either the ramparts and keep of the one, or the cloisters\\nof the other, had been for many weeks a darling wish, though to be more\\nthan the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire.\\nAnd yet, this was to happen. With all the chances against her of house,\\nhall, place, park, court, and cottage, Northanger turned up an abbey,\\nand she was to be its inhabitant. Its long, damp passages, its narrow\\ncells and ruined chapel, were to be within her daily reach, and she\\ncould not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends, some\\nawful memorials of an injured and ill-fated nun.\\n\\nIt was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by the\\npossession of such a home, that the consciousness of it should be so\\nmeekly borne. The power of early habit only could account for it. A\\ndistinction to which they had been born gave no pride. Their superiority\\nof abode was no more to them than their superiority of person.\\n\\nMany were the inquiries she was eager to make of Miss Tilney; but so\\nactive were her thoughts, that when these inquiries were answered, she\\nwas hardly more assured than before, of Northanger Abbey having been\\na richly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation, of its having\\nfallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on its dissolution,\\nof a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the\\npresent dwelling although the rest was decayed, or of its standing low\\nin a valley, sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 18\\n\\n\\nWith a mind thus full of happiness, Catherine was hardly aware that two\\nor three days had passed away, without her seeing Isabella for more than\\na few minutes together. She began first to be sensible of this, and\\nto sigh for her conversation, as she walked along the pump-room one\\nmorning, by Mrs. Allen's side, without anything to say or to hear; and\\nscarcely had she felt a five minutes' longing of friendship, before the\\nobject of it appeared, and inviting her to a secret conference, led the\\nway to a seat. \"This is my favourite place,\" said she as they sat\\ndown on a bench between the doors, which commanded a tolerable view of\\neverybody entering at either; \"it is so out of the way.\"\\n\\nCatherine, observing that Isabella's eyes were continually bent towards\\none door or the other, as in eager expectation, and remembering how\\noften she had been falsely accused of being arch, thought the present a\\nfine opportunity for being really so; and therefore gaily said, \"Do not\\nbe uneasy, Isabella, James will soon be here.\"\\n\\n\"Psha! My dear creature,\" she replied, \"do not think me such a simpleton\\nas to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow. It would be hideous\\nto be always together; we should be the jest of the place. And so you\\nare going to Northanger! I am amazingly glad of it. It is one of the\\nfinest old places in England, I understand. I shall depend upon a most\\nparticular description of it.\"\\n\\n\"You shall certainly have the best in my power to give. But who are you\\nlooking for? Are your sisters coming?\"\\n\\n\"I am not looking for anybody. One's eyes must be somewhere, and you\\nknow what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine, when my thoughts are an\\nhundred miles off. I am amazingly absent; I believe I am the most absent\\ncreature in the world. Tilney says it is always the case with minds of a\\ncertain stamp.\"\\n\\n\"But I thought, Isabella, you had something in particular to tell me?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Yes, and so I have. But here is a proof of what I was saying. My\\npoor head, I had quite forgot it. Well, the thing is this: I have just\\nhad a letter from John; you can guess the contents.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I cannot.\"\\n\\n\"My sweet love, do not be so abominably affected. What can he write\\nabout, but yourself? You know he is over head and ears in love with\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"With me, dear Isabella!\"\\n\\n\"Nay, my sweetest Catherine, this is being quite absurd! Modesty, and\\nall that, is very well in its way, but really a little common honesty is\\nsometimes quite as becoming. I have no idea of being so overstrained!\\nIt is fishing for compliments. His attentions were such as a child must\\nhave noticed. And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you\\ngave him the most positive encouragement. He says so in this letter,\\nsays that he as good as made you an offer, and that you received his\\nadvances in the kindest way; and now he wants me to urge his suit,\\nand say all manner of pretty things to you. So it is in vain to affect\\nignorance.\"\\n\\nCatherine, with all the earnestness of truth, expressed her astonishment\\nat such a charge, protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr.\\nThorpe's being in love with her, and the consequent impossibility of\\nher having ever intended to encourage him. \"As to any attentions on his\\nside, I do declare, upon my honour, I never was sensible of them for a\\nmoment--except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming.\\nAnd as to making me an offer, or anything like it, there must be some\\nunaccountable mistake. I could not have misunderstood a thing of that\\nkind, you know! And, as I ever wish to be believed, I solemnly protest\\nthat no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us. The last half\\nhour before he went away! It must be all and completely a mistake--for I\\ndid not see him once that whole morning.\"\\n\\n\"But that you certainly did, for you spent the whole morning in Edgar's\\nBuildings--it was the day your father's consent came--and I am pretty\\nsure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you\\nleft the house.\"\\n\\n\"Are you? Well, if you say it, it was so, I dare say--but for the life\\nof me, I cannot recollect it. I do remember now being with you, and\\nseeing him as well as the rest--but that we were ever alone for five\\nminutes--However, it is not worth arguing about, for whatever might pass\\non his side, you must be convinced, by my having no recollection of it,\\nthat I never thought, nor expected, nor wished for anything of the kind\\nfrom him. I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for\\nme--but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side; I never had\\nthe smallest idea of it. Pray undeceive him as soon as you can, and tell\\nhim I beg his pardon--that is--I do not know what I ought to say--but\\nmake him understand what I mean, in the properest way. I would not speak\\ndisrespectfully of a brother of yours, Isabella, I am sure; but you know\\nvery well that if I could think of one man more than another--he is not\\nthe person.\" Isabella was silent. \"My dear friend, you must not be angry\\nwith me. I cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me. And,\\nyou know, we shall still be sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes\" (with a blush), \"there are more ways than one of our being\\nsisters. But where am I wandering to? Well, my dear Catherine, the case\\nseems to be that you are determined against poor John--is not it so?\"\\n\\n\"I certainly cannot return his affection, and as certainly never meant\\nto encourage it.\"\\n\\n\"Since that is the case, I am sure I shall not tease you any further.\\nJohn desired me to speak to you on the subject, and therefore I have.\\nBut I confess, as soon as I read his letter, I thought it a very\\nfoolish, imprudent business, and not likely to promote the good of\\neither; for what were you to live upon, supposing you came together? You\\nhave both of you something, to be sure, but it is not a trifle that will\\nsupport a family nowadays; and after all that romancers may say, there\\nis no doing without money. I only wonder John could think of it; he\\ncould not have received my last.\"\\n\\n\"You do acquit me, then, of anything wrong?--You are convinced that I\\nnever meant to deceive your brother, never suspected him of liking me\\ntill this moment?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! As to that,\" answered Isabella laughingly, \"I do not pretend to\\ndetermine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been. All\\nthat is best known to yourself. A little harmless flirtation or so will\\noccur, and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one\\nwishes to stand by. But you may be assured that I am the last person in\\nthe world to judge you severely. All those things should be allowed for\\nin youth and high spirits. What one means one day, you know, one may not\\nmean the next. Circumstances change, opinions alter.\"\\n\\n\"But my opinion of your brother never did alter; it was always the same.\\nYou are describing what never happened.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest Catherine,\" continued the other without at all listening to\\nher, \"I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an\\nengagement before you knew what you were about. I do not think anything\\nwould justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely\\nto oblige my brother, because he is my brother, and who perhaps after\\nall, you know, might be just as happy without you, for people seldom\\nknow what they would be at, young men especially, they are so amazingly\\nchangeable and inconstant. What I say is, why should a brother's\\nhappiness be dearer to me than a friend's? You know I carry my notions\\nof friendship pretty high. But, above all things, my dear Catherine, do\\nnot be in a hurry. Take my word for it, that if you are in too great\\na hurry, you will certainly live to repent it. Tilney says there is\\nnothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own\\naffections, and I believe he is very right. Ah! Here he comes; never\\nmind, he will not see us, I am sure.\"\\n\\nCatherine, looking up, perceived Captain Tilney; and Isabella,\\nearnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke, soon caught his notice. He\\napproached immediately, and took the seat to which her movements invited\\nhim. His first address made Catherine start. Though spoken low, she\\ncould distinguish, \"What! Always to be watched, in person or by proxy!\"\\n\\n\"Psha, nonsense!\" was Isabella's answer in the same half whisper. \"Why\\ndo you put such things into my head? If I could believe it--my spirit,\\nyou know, is pretty independent.\"\\n\\n\"I wish your heart were independent. That would be enough for me.\"\\n\\n\"My heart, indeed! What can you have to do with hearts? You men have\\nnone of you any hearts.\"\\n\\n\"If we have not hearts, we have eyes; and they give us torment enough.\"\\n\\n\"Do they? I am sorry for it; I am sorry they find anything so\\ndisagreeable in me. I will look another way. I hope this pleases you\"\\n(turning her back on him); \"I hope your eyes are not tormented now.\"\\n\\n\"Never more so; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view--at\\nonce too much and too little.\"\\n\\nCatherine heard all this, and quite out of countenance, could listen\\nno longer. Amazed that Isabella could endure it, and jealous for her\\nbrother, she rose up, and saying she should join Mrs. Allen, proposed\\ntheir walking. But for this Isabella showed no inclination. She was so\\namazingly tired, and it was so odious to parade about the pump-room;\\nand if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters; she was\\nexpecting her sisters every moment; so that her dearest Catherine must\\nexcuse her, and must sit quietly down again. But Catherine could be\\nstubborn too; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their\\nreturning home, she joined her and walked out of the pump-room, leaving\\nIsabella still sitting with Captain Tilney. With much uneasiness did\\nshe thus leave them. It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling\\nin love with Isabella, and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him;\\nunconsciously it must be, for Isabella's attachment to James was as\\ncertain and well acknowledged as her engagement. To doubt her truth\\nor good intentions was impossible; and yet, during the whole of their\\nconversation her manner had been odd. She wished Isabella had talked\\nmore like her usual self, and not so much about money, and had not\\nlooked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney. How strange that\\nshe should not perceive his admiration! Catherine longed to give her a\\nhint of it, to put her on her guard, and prevent all the pain which\\nher too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her\\nbrother.\\n\\nThe compliment of John Thorpe's affection did not make amends for this\\nthoughtlessness in his sister. She was almost as far from believing as\\nfrom wishing it to be sincere; for she had not forgotten that he\\ncould mistake, and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragement\\nconvinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious.\\nIn vanity, therefore, she gained but little; her chief profit was in\\nwonder. That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love\\nwith her was a matter of lively astonishment. Isabella talked of his\\nattentions; she had never been sensible of any; but Isabella had said\\nmany things which she hoped had been spoken in haste, and would never\\nbe said again; and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for present\\nease and comfort.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 19\\n\\n\\nA few days passed away, and Catherine, though not allowing herself to\\nsuspect her friend, could not help watching her closely. The result of\\nher observations was not agreeable. Isabella seemed an altered creature.\\nWhen she saw her, indeed, surrounded only by their immediate friends\\nin Edgar's Buildings or Pulteney Street, her change of manners was so\\ntrifling that, had it gone no farther, it might have passed unnoticed.\\nA something of languid indifference, or of that boasted absence of\\nmind which Catherine had never heard of before, would occasionally come\\nacross her; but had nothing worse appeared, that might only have spread\\na new grace and inspired a warmer interest. But when Catherine saw her\\nin public, admitting Captain Tilney's attentions as readily as they were\\noffered, and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice\\nand smiles, the alteration became too positive to be passed over. What\\ncould be meant by such unsteady conduct, what her friend could be at,\\nwas beyond her comprehension. Isabella could not be aware of the pain\\nshe was inflicting; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which\\nCatherine could not but resent. James was the sufferer. She saw him\\ngrave and uneasy; and however careless of his present comfort the woman\\nmight be who had given him her heart, to her it was always an object.\\nFor poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned. Though his looks\\ndid not please her, his name was a passport to her goodwill, and she\\nthought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment; for,\\nin spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump-room,\\nhis behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella's\\nengagement that she could not, upon reflection, imagine him aware of it.\\nHe might be jealous of her brother as a rival, but if more had seemed\\nimplied, the fault must have been in her misapprehension. She wished, by\\na gentle remonstrance, to remind Isabella of her situation, and make\\nher aware of this double unkindness; but for remonstrance, either\\nopportunity or comprehension was always against her. If able to suggest\\na hint, Isabella could never understand it. In this distress, the\\nintended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation;\\ntheir journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days,\\nand Captain Tilney's removal would at least restore peace to every heart\\nbut his own. But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing;\\nhe was not to be of the party to Northanger; he was to continue at Bath.\\nWhen Catherine knew this, her resolution was directly made. She spoke to\\nHenry Tilney on the subject, regretting his brother's evident partiality\\nfor Miss Thorpe, and entreating him to make known her prior engagement.\\n\\n\"My brother does know it,\" was Henry's answer.\\n\\n\"Does he? Then why does he stay here?\"\\n\\nHe made no reply, and was beginning to talk of something else; but she\\neagerly continued, \"Why do not you persuade him to go away? The longer\\nhe stays, the worse it will be for him at last. Pray advise him for his\\nown sake, and for everybody's sake, to leave Bath directly. Absence will\\nin time make him comfortable again; but he can have no hope here, and it\\nis only staying to be miserable.\"\\n\\nHenry smiled and said, \"I am sure my brother would not wish to do that.\"\\n\\n\"Then you will persuade him to go away?\"\\n\\n\"Persuasion is not at command; but pardon me, if I cannot even endeavour\\nto persuade him. I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged. He\\nknows what he is about, and must be his own master.\"\\n\\n\"No, he does not know what he is about,\" cried Catherine; \"he does not\\nknow the pain he is giving my brother. Not that James has ever told me\\nso, but I am sure he is very uncomfortable.\"\\n\\n\"And are you sure it is my brother's doing?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very sure.\"\\n\\n\"Is it my brother's attentions to Miss Thorpe, or Miss Thorpe's\\nadmission of them, that gives the pain?\"\\n\\n\"Is not it the same thing?\"\\n\\n\"I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference. No man is offended\\nby another man's admiration of the woman he loves; it is the woman only\\nwho can make it a torment.\"\\n\\nCatherine blushed for her friend, and said, \"Isabella is wrong. But I\\nam sure she cannot mean to torment, for she is very much attached to my\\nbrother. She has been in love with him ever since they first met, and\\nwhile my father's consent was uncertain, she fretted herself almost into\\na fever. You know she must be attached to him.\"\\n\\n\"I understand: she is in love with James, and flirts with Frederick.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, not flirts. A woman in love with one man cannot flirt with\\nanother.\"\\n\\n\"It is probable that she will neither love so well, nor flirt so\\nwell, as she might do either singly. The gentlemen must each give up a\\nlittle.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause, Catherine resumed with, \"Then you do not believe\\nIsabella so very much attached to my brother?\"\\n\\n\"I can have no opinion on that subject.\"\\n\\n\"But what can your brother mean? If he knows her engagement, what can he\\nmean by his behaviour?\"\\n\\n\"You are a very close questioner.\"\\n\\n\"Am I? I only ask what I want to be told.\"\\n\\n\"But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I think so; for you must know your brother's heart.\"\\n\\n\"My brother's heart, as you term it, on the present occasion, I assure\\nyou I can only guess at.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"Well! Nay, if it is to be guesswork, let us all guess for ourselves. To\\nbe guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful. The premises are before\\nyou. My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young\\nman; he has had about a week's acquaintance with your friend, and he has\\nknown her engagement almost as long as he has known her.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Catherine, after some moments' consideration, \"you may be\\nable to guess at your brother's intentions from all this; but I am sure\\nI cannot. But is not your father uncomfortable about it? Does not he\\nwant Captain Tilney to go away? Sure, if your father were to speak to\\nhim, he would go.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Morland,\" said Henry, \"in this amiable solicitude for your\\nbrother's comfort, may you not be a little mistaken? Are you not carried\\na little too far? Would he thank you, either on his own account or\\nMiss Thorpe's, for supposing that her affection, or at least her good\\nbehaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain\\nTilney? Is he safe only in solitude? Or is her heart constant to him\\nonly when unsolicited by anyone else? He cannot think this--and you may\\nbe sure that he would not have you think it. I will not say, 'Do not\\nbe uneasy,' because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as\\nlittle uneasy as you can. You have no doubt of the mutual attachment\\nof your brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, that\\nreal jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no\\ndisagreement between them can be of any duration. Their hearts are open\\nto each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly what\\nis required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will\\nnever tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant.\"\\n\\nPerceiving her still to look doubtful and grave, he added, \"Though\\nFrederick does not leave Bath with us, he will probably remain but a\\nvery short time, perhaps only a few days behind us. His leave of absence\\nwill soon expire, and he must return to his regiment. And what will then\\nbe their acquaintance? The mess-room will drink Isabella Thorpe for\\na fortnight, and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney's\\npassion for a month.\"\\n\\nCatherine would contend no longer against comfort. She had resisted its\\napproaches during the whole length of a speech, but it now carried her\\ncaptive. Henry Tilney must know best. She blamed herself for the extent\\nof her fears, and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject\\nagain.\\n\\nHer resolution was supported by Isabella's behaviour in their parting\\ninterview. The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine's stay in\\nPulteney Street, and nothing passed between the lovers to excite\\nher uneasiness, or make her quit them in apprehension. James was in\\nexcellent spirits, and Isabella most engagingly placid. Her tenderness\\nfor her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart; but that\\nat such a moment was allowable; and once she gave her lover a flat\\ncontradiction, and once she drew back her hand; but Catherine remembered\\nHenry's instructions, and placed it all to judicious affection. The\\nembraces, tears, and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 20\\n\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry to lose their young friend, whose good\\nhumour and cheerfulness had made her a valuable companion, and in the\\npromotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased. Her\\nhappiness in going with Miss Tilney, however, prevented their wishing\\nit otherwise; and, as they were to remain only one more week in Bath\\nthemselves, her quitting them now would not long be felt. Mr. Allen\\nattended her to Milsom Street, where she was to breakfast, and saw her\\nseated with the kindest welcome among her new friends; but so great was\\nher agitation in finding herself as one of the family, and so fearful\\nwas she of not doing exactly what was right, and of not being able to\\npreserve their good opinion, that, in the embarrassment of the first\\nfive minutes, she could almost have wished to return with him to\\nPulteney Street.\\n\\nMiss Tilney's manners and Henry's smile soon did away some of her\\nunpleasant feelings; but still she was far from being at ease; nor could\\nthe incessant attentions of the general himself entirely reassure her.\\nNay, perverse as it seemed, she doubted whether she might not have felt\\nless, had she been less attended to. His anxiety for her comfort--his\\ncontinual solicitations that she would eat, and his often-expressed\\nfears of her seeing nothing to her taste--though never in her life\\nbefore had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast-table--made it\\nimpossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor. She\\nfelt utterly unworthy of such respect, and knew not how to reply to it.\\nHer tranquillity was not improved by the general's impatience for the\\nappearance of his eldest son, nor by the displeasure he expressed at his\\nlaziness when Captain Tilney at last came down. She was quite pained by\\nthe severity of his father's reproof, which seemed disproportionate to\\nthe offence; and much was her concern increased when she found herself\\nthe principal cause of the lecture, and that his tardiness was chiefly\\nresented from being disrespectful to her. This was placing her in a\\nvery uncomfortable situation, and she felt great compassion for Captain\\nTilney, without being able to hope for his goodwill.\\n\\nHe listened to his father in silence, and attempted not any defence,\\nwhich confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind, on\\nIsabella's account, might, by keeping him long sleepless, have been\\nthe real cause of his rising late. It was the first time of her being\\ndecidedly in his company, and she had hoped to be now able to form\\nher opinion of him; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father\\nremained in the room; and even afterwards, so much were his spirits\\naffected, she could distinguish nothing but these words, in a whisper to\\nEleanor, \"How glad I shall be when you are all off.\"\\n\\nThe bustle of going was not pleasant. The clock struck ten while the\\ntrunks were carrying down, and the general had fixed to be out of Milsom\\nStreet by that hour. His greatcoat, instead of being brought for him\\nto put on directly, was spread out in the curricle in which he was to\\naccompany his son. The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out,\\nthough there were three people to go in it, and his daughter's maid had\\nso crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to sit;\\nand, so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed her\\nin, that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing-desk from\\nbeing thrown out into the street. At last, however, the door was closed\\nupon the three females, and they set off at the sober pace in which\\nthe handsome, highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a\\njourney of thirty miles: such was the distance of Northanger from Bath,\\nto be now divided into two equal stages. Catherine's spirits revived as\\nthey drove from the door; for with Miss Tilney she felt no restraint;\\nand, with the interest of a road entirely new to her, of an abbey\\nbefore, and a curricle behind, she caught the last view of Bath without\\nany regret, and met with every milestone before she expected it. The\\ntediousness of a two hours' wait at Petty France, in which there was\\nnothing to be done but to eat without being hungry, and loiter about\\nwithout anything to see, next followed--and her admiration of the style\\nin which they travelled, of the fashionable chaise and four--postilions\\nhandsomely liveried, rising so regularly in their stirrups, and\\nnumerous outriders properly mounted, sunk a little under this consequent\\ninconvenience. Had their party been perfectly agreeable, the delay would\\nhave been nothing; but General Tilney, though so charming a man, seemed\\nalways a check upon his children's spirits, and scarcely anything was\\nsaid but by himself; the observation of which, with his discontent at\\nwhatever the inn afforded, and his angry impatience at the waiters, made\\nCatherine grow every moment more in awe of him, and appeared to lengthen\\nthe two hours into four. At last, however, the order of release was\\ngiven; and much was Catherine then surprised by the general's proposal\\nof her taking his place in his son's curricle for the rest of the\\njourney: \"the day was fine, and he was anxious for her seeing as much of\\nthe country as possible.\"\\n\\nThe remembrance of Mr. Allen's opinion, respecting young men's open\\ncarriages, made her blush at the mention of such a plan, and her first\\nthought was to decline it; but her second was of greater deference for\\nGeneral Tilney's judgment; he could not propose anything improper for\\nher; and, in the course of a few minutes, she found herself with Henry\\nin the curricle, as happy a being as ever existed. A very short trial\\nconvinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world;\\nthe chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur, to be sure, but it\\nwas a heavy and troublesome business, and she could not easily forget\\nits having stopped two hours at Petty France. Half the time would\\nhave been enough for the curricle, and so nimbly were the light horses\\ndisposed to move, that, had not the general chosen to have his own\\ncarriage lead the way, they could have passed it with ease in half a\\nminute. But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses;\\nHenry drove so well--so quietly--without making any disturbance,\\nwithout parading to her, or swearing at them: so different from the only\\ngentleman-coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with! And\\nthen his hat sat so well, and the innumerable capes of his greatcoat\\nlooked so becomingly important! To be driven by him, next to being\\ndancing with him, was certainly the greatest happiness in the world. In\\naddition to every other delight, she had now that of listening to her\\nown praise; of being thanked at least, on his sister's account, for\\nher kindness in thus becoming her visitor; of hearing it ranked as real\\nfriendship, and described as creating real gratitude. His sister, he\\nsaid, was uncomfortably circumstanced--she had no female companion--and,\\nin the frequent absence of her father, was sometimes without any\\ncompanion at all.\\n\\n\"But how can that be?\" said Catherine. \"Are not you with her?\"\\n\\n\"Northanger is not more than half my home; I have an establishment at\\nmy own house in Woodston, which is nearly twenty miles from my father's,\\nand some of my time is necessarily spent there.\"\\n\\n\"How sorry you must be for that!\"\\n\\n\"I am always sorry to leave Eleanor.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but besides your affection for her, you must be so fond of\\nthe abbey! After being used to such a home as the abbey, an ordinary\\nparsonage-house must be very disagreeable.\"\\n\\nHe smiled, and said, \"You have formed a very favourable idea of the\\nabbey.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure, I have. Is not it a fine old place, just like what one\\nreads about?\"\\n\\n\"And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such\\nas 'what one reads about' may produce? Have you a stout heart? Nerves\\nfit for sliding panels and tapestry?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--I do not think I should be easily frightened, because there\\nwould be so many people in the house--and besides, it has never been\\nuninhabited and left deserted for years, and then the family come back\\nto it unawares, without giving any notice, as generally happens.\"\\n\\n\"No, certainly. We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly\\nlighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire--nor be obliged to spread\\nour beds on the floor of a room without windows, doors, or furniture.\\nBut you must be aware that when a young lady is (by whatever means)\\nintroduced into a dwelling of this kind, she is always lodged apart from\\nthe rest of the family. While they snugly repair to their own end of the\\nhouse, she is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient housekeeper, up\\na different staircase, and along many gloomy passages, into an apartment\\nnever used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years\\nbefore. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not your mind\\nmisgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber--too lofty and\\nextensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take\\nin its size--its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as\\nlife, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even\\na funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! But this will not happen to me, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment! And\\nwhat will you discern? Not tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers,\\nbut on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute, on the other a\\nponderous chest which no efforts can open, and over the fireplace\\nthe portrait of some handsome warrior, whose features will so\\nincomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be able to withdraw your\\neyes from it. Dorothy, meanwhile, no less struck by your appearance,\\ngazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few unintelligible hints.\\nTo raise your spirits, moreover, she gives you reason to suppose that\\nthe part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted, and informs\\nyou that you will not have a single domestic within call. With this\\nparting cordial she curtsies off--you listen to the sound of her\\nreceding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you--and when,\\nwith fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover,\\nwith increased alarm, that it has no lock.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Mr. Tilney, how frightful! This is just like a book! But it cannot\\nreally happen to me. I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy.\\nWell, what then?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night. After\\nsurmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed, you will retire to\\nrest, and get a few hours' unquiet slumber. But on the second, or at\\nfarthest the third night after your arrival, you will probably have a\\nviolent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice\\nto its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains--and during\\nthe frightful gusts of wind which accompany it, you will probably think\\nyou discern (for your lamp is not extinguished) one part of the hanging\\nmore violently agitated than the rest. Unable of course to repress your\\ncuriosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it, you will instantly\\narise, and throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to examine\\nthis mystery. After a very short search, you will discover a division in\\nthe tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection,\\nand on opening it, a door will immediately appear--which door, being\\nonly secured by massy bars and a padlock, you will, after a few efforts,\\nsucceed in opening--and, with your lamp in your hand, will pass through\\nit into a small vaulted room.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing.\"\\n\\n\"What! Not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a\\nsecret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel\\nof St. Anthony, scarcely two miles off? Could you shrink from so simple\\nan adventure? No, no, you will proceed into this small vaulted room,\\nand through this into several others, without perceiving anything very\\nremarkable in either. In one perhaps there may be a dagger, in another\\na few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some instrument of\\ntorture; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way,\\nand your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return towards your own\\napartment. In repassing through the small vaulted room, however, your\\neyes will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of ebony\\nand gold, which, though narrowly examining the furniture before, you\\nhad passed unnoticed. Impelled by an irresistible presentiment, you will\\neagerly advance to it, unlock its folding doors, and search into\\nevery drawer--but for some time without discovering anything of\\nimportance--perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds. At\\nlast, however, by touching a secret spring, an inner compartment will\\nopen--a roll of paper appears--you seize it--it contains many sheets of\\nmanuscript--you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber,\\nbut scarcely have you been able to decipher 'Oh! Thou--whomsoever thou\\nmayst be, into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may\\nfall'--when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket, and leaves you in\\ntotal darkness.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! No, no--do not say so. Well, go on.\"\\n\\nBut Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able\\nto carry it farther; he could no longer command solemnity either of\\nsubject or voice, and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy\\nin the perusal of Matilda's woes. Catherine, recollecting herself, grew\\nashamed of her eagerness, and began earnestly to assure him that her\\nattention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really\\nmeeting with what he related. \"Miss Tilney, she was sure, would never\\nput her into such a chamber as he had described! She was not at all\\nafraid.\"\\n\\nAs they drew near the end of their journey, her impatience for a sight\\nof the abbey--for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects\\nvery different--returned in full force, and every bend in the road was\\nexpected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey\\nstone, rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks, with the last beams of the\\nsun playing in beautiful splendour on its high Gothic windows. But so\\nlow did the building stand, that she found herself passing through the\\ngreat gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger, without\\nhaving discerned even an antique chimney.\\n\\nShe knew not that she had any right to be surprised, but there was a\\nsomething in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected.\\nTo pass between lodges of a modern appearance, to find herself with such\\nease in the very precincts of the abbey, and driven so rapidly along a\\nsmooth, level road of fine gravel, without obstacle, alarm, or solemnity\\nof any kind, struck her as odd and inconsistent. She was not long\\nat leisure, however, for such considerations. A sudden scud of rain,\\ndriving full in her face, made it impossible for her to observe anything\\nfurther, and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new straw\\nbonnet; and she was actually under the abbey walls, was springing, with\\nHenry's assistance, from the carriage, was beneath the shelter of the\\nold porch, and had even passed on to the hall, where her friend and\\nthe general were waiting to welcome her, without feeling one awful\\nforeboding of future misery to herself, or one moment's suspicion of any\\npast scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice. The breeze\\nhad not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her; it had wafted\\nnothing worse than a thick mizzling rain; and having given a good shake\\nto her habit, she was ready to be shown into the common drawing-room,\\nand capable of considering where she was.\\n\\nAn abbey! Yes, it was delightful to be really in an abbey! But she\\ndoubted, as she looked round the room, whether anything within her\\nobservation would have given her the consciousness. The furniture was in\\nall the profusion and elegance of modern taste. The fireplace, where she\\nhad expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times, was\\ncontracted to a Rumford, with slabs of plain though handsome marble, and\\nornaments over it of the prettiest English china. The windows, to which\\nshe looked with peculiar dependence, from having heard the general talk\\nof his preserving them in their Gothic form with reverential care, were\\nyet less what her fancy had portrayed. To be sure, the pointed arch\\nwas preserved--the form of them was Gothic--they might be even\\ncasements--but every pane was so large, so clear, so light! To an\\nimagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions, and the heaviest\\nstone-work, for painted glass, dirt, and cobwebs, the difference was\\nvery distressing.\\n\\nThe general, perceiving how her eye was employed, began to talk of the\\nsmallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture, where everything,\\nbeing for daily use, pretended only to comfort, etc.; flattering\\nhimself, however, that there were some apartments in the Abbey not\\nunworthy her notice--and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding\\nof one in particular, when, taking out his watch, he stopped short to\\npronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five! This seemed\\nthe word of separation, and Catherine found herself hurried away by Miss\\nTilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest punctuality\\nto the family hours would be expected at Northanger.\\n\\nReturning through the large and lofty hall, they ascended a broad\\nstaircase of shining oak, which, after many flights and many\\nlanding-places, brought them upon a long, wide gallery. On one side it\\nhad a range of doors, and it was lighted on the other by windows which\\nCatherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle, before\\nMiss Tilney led the way into a chamber, and scarcely staying to hope she\\nwould find it comfortable, left her with an anxious entreaty that she\\nwould make as little alteration as possible in her dress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 21\\n\\n\\nA moment's glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment\\nwas very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the\\ndescription of. It was by no means unreasonably large, and contained\\nneither tapestry nor velvet. The walls were papered, the floor was\\ncarpeted; the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those\\nof the drawing-room below; the furniture, though not of the latest\\nfashion, was handsome and comfortable, and the air of the room\\naltogether far from uncheerful. Her heart instantaneously at ease on\\nthis point, she resolved to lose no time in particular examination of\\nanything, as she greatly dreaded disobliging the general by any delay.\\nHer habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste, and she was\\npreparing to unpin the linen package, which the chaise-seat had conveyed\\nfor her immediate accommodation, when her eye suddenly fell on a large\\nhigh chest, standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace.\\nThe sight of it made her start; and, forgetting everything else, she\\nstood gazing on it in motionless wonder, while these thoughts crossed\\nher:\\n\\n\"This is strange indeed! I did not expect such a sight as this! An\\nimmense heavy chest! What can it hold? Why should it be placed here?\\nPushed back too, as if meant to be out of sight! I will look into\\nit--cost me what it may, I will look into it--and directly too--by\\ndaylight. If I stay till evening my candle may go out.\" She advanced and\\nexamined it closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some darker\\nwood, and raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved stand of the\\nsame. The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at each end\\nwere the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken perhaps\\nprematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the lid, was\\na mysterious cipher, in the same metal. Catherine bent over it intently,\\nbut without being able to distinguish anything with certainty. She could\\nnot, in whatever direction she took it, believe the last letter to be\\na T; and yet that it should be anything else in that house was\\na circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment. If not\\noriginally theirs, by what strange events could it have fallen into the\\nTilney family?\\n\\nHer fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater; and seizing,\\nwith trembling hands, the hasp of the lock, she resolved at all hazards\\nto satisfy herself at least as to its contents. With difficulty, for\\nsomething seemed to resist her efforts, she raised the lid a few inches;\\nbut at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her,\\nstarting, quit her hold, and the lid closed with alarming violence. This\\nill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney's maid, sent by her mistress to be of\\nuse to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her, it\\nrecalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing, and forced her,\\nin spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to proceed in\\nher dressing without further delay. Her progress was not quick, for her\\nthoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated\\nto interest and alarm; and though she dared not waste a moment upon\\na second attempt, she could not remain many paces from the chest. At\\nlength, however, having slipped one arm into her gown, her toilette\\nseemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might\\nsafely be indulged. One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperate\\nshould be the exertion of her strength, that, unless secured by\\nsupernatural means, the lid in one moment should be thrown back. With\\nthis spirit she sprang forward, and her confidence did not deceive her.\\nHer resolute effort threw back the lid, and gave to her astonished eyes\\nthe view of a white cotton counterpane, properly folded, reposing at one\\nend of the chest in undisputed possession!\\n\\nShe was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney,\\nanxious for her friend's being ready, entered the room, and to the\\nrising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation,\\nwas then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search. \"That is\\na curious old chest, is not it?\" said Miss Tilney, as Catherine hastily\\nclosed it and turned away to the glass. \"It is impossible to say how\\nmany generations it has been here. How it came to be first put in this\\nroom I know not, but I have not had it moved, because I thought it might\\nsometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets. The worst of it is that\\nits weight makes it difficult to open. In that corner, however, it is at\\nleast out of the way.\"\\n\\nCatherine had no leisure for speech, being at once blushing, tying her\\ngown, and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch. Miss\\nTilney gently hinted her fear of being late; and in half a minute they\\nran downstairs together, in an alarm not wholly unfounded, for General\\nTilney was pacing the drawing-room, his watch in his hand, and having,\\non the very instant of their entering, pulled the bell with violence,\\nordered \"Dinner to be on table directly!\"\\n\\nCatherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke, and sat pale\\nand breathless, in a most humble mood, concerned for his children, and\\ndetesting old chests; and the general, recovering his politeness as he\\nlooked at her, spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for\\nso foolishly hurrying her fair friend, who was absolutely out of breath\\nfrom haste, when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the\\nworld: but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress\\nof having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton\\nherself, till they were happily seated at the dinner-table, when the\\ngeneral's complacent smiles, and a good appetite of her own, restored\\nher to peace. The dining-parlour was a noble room, suitable in its\\ndimensions to a much larger drawing-room than the one in common use, and\\nfitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the\\nunpractised eye of Catherine, who saw little more than its spaciousness\\nand the number of their attendants. Of the former, she spoke aloud\\nher admiration; and the general, with a very gracious countenance,\\nacknowledged that it was by no means an ill-sized room, and further\\nconfessed that, though as careless on such subjects as most people, he\\ndid look upon a tolerably large eating-room as one of the necessaries\\nof life; he supposed, however, \"that she must have been used to much\\nbetter-sized apartments at Mr. Allen's?\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" was Catherine's honest assurance; \"Mr. Allen's\\ndining-parlour was not more than half as large,\" and she had never\\nseen so large a room as this in her life. The general's good humour\\nincreased. Why, as he had such rooms, he thought it would be simple not\\nto make use of them; but, upon his honour, he believed there might be\\nmore comfort in rooms of only half their size. Mr. Allen's house, he was\\nsure, must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness.\\n\\nThe evening passed without any further disturbance, and, in the\\noccasional absence of General Tilney, with much positive cheerfulness.\\nIt was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue\\nfrom her journey; and even then, even in moments of languor or\\nrestraint, a sense of general happiness preponderated, and she could\\nthink of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them.\\n\\nThe night was stormy; the wind had been rising at intervals the whole\\nafternoon; and by the time the party broke up, it blew and rained\\nviolently. Catherine, as she crossed the hall, listened to the tempest\\nwith sensations of awe; and, when she heard it rage round a corner of\\nthe ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door, felt\\nfor the first time that she was really in an abbey. Yes, these were\\ncharacteristic sounds; they brought to her recollection a countless\\nvariety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes, which such buildings\\nhad witnessed, and such storms ushered in; and most heartily did she\\nrejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls\\nso solemn! She had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken\\ngallants. Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her\\nthat morning. In a house so furnished, and so guarded, she could have\\nnothing to explore or to suffer, and might go to her bedroom as securely\\nas if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton. Thus wisely fortifying\\nher mind, as she proceeded upstairs, she was enabled, especially on\\nperceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her, to enter\\nher room with a tolerably stout heart; and her spirits were immediately\\nassisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire. \"How much better is\\nthis,\" said she, as she walked to the fender--\"how much better to find a\\nfire ready lit, than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the\\nfamily are in bed, as so many poor girls have been obliged to do, and\\nthen to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a\\nfaggot! How glad I am that Northanger is what it is! If it had been like\\nsome other places, I do not know that, in such a night as this, I could\\nhave answered for my courage: but now, to be sure, there is nothing to\\nalarm one.\"\\n\\nShe looked round the room. The window curtains seemed in motion. It\\ncould be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the\\ndivisions of the shutters; and she stepped boldly forward, carelessly\\nhumming a tune, to assure herself of its being so, peeped courageously\\nbehind each curtain, saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her,\\nand on placing a hand against the shutter, felt the strongest conviction\\nof the wind's force. A glance at the old chest, as she turned away from\\nthis examination, was not without its use; she scorned the causeless\\nfears of an idle fancy, and began with a most happy indifference to\\nprepare herself for bed. \"She should take her time; she should not hurry\\nherself; she did not care if she were the last person up in the house.\\nBut she would not make up her fire; that would seem cowardly, as if\\nshe wished for the protection of light after she were in bed.\" The fire\\ntherefore died away, and Catherine, having spent the best part of an\\nhour in her arrangements, was beginning to think of stepping into bed,\\nwhen, on giving a parting glance round the room, she was struck by the\\nappearance of a high, old-fashioned black cabinet, which, though in\\na situation conspicuous enough, had never caught her notice before.\\nHenry's words, his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape\\nher observation at first, immediately rushed across her; and though\\nthere could be nothing really in it, there was something whimsical, it\\nwas certainly a very remarkable coincidence! She took her candle and\\nlooked closely at the cabinet. It was not absolutely ebony and gold; but\\nit was japan, black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind; and as she\\nheld her candle, the yellow had very much the effect of gold. The key\\nwas in the door, and she had a strange fancy to look into it; not,\\nhowever, with the smallest expectation of finding anything, but it was\\nso very odd, after what Henry had said. In short, she could not sleep\\ntill she had examined it. So, placing the candle with great caution on\\na chair, she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn\\nit; but it resisted her utmost strength. Alarmed, but not discouraged,\\nshe tried it another way; a bolt flew, and she believed herself\\nsuccessful; but how strangely mysterious! The door was still immovable.\\nShe paused a moment in breathless wonder. The wind roared down the\\nchimney, the rain beat in torrents against the windows, and everything\\nseemed to speak the awfulness of her situation. To retire to bed,\\nhowever, unsatisfied on such a point, would be vain, since sleep must be\\nimpossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed\\nin her immediate vicinity. Again, therefore, she applied herself to the\\nkey, and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with\\nthe determined celerity of hope's last effort, the door suddenly yielded\\nto her hand: her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory, and\\nhaving thrown open each folding door, the second being secured only by\\nbolts of less wonderful construction than the lock, though in that her\\neye could not discern anything unusual, a double range of small drawers\\nappeared in view, with some larger drawers above and below them; and in\\nthe centre, a small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured in\\nall probability a cavity of importance.\\n\\nCatherine's heart beat quick, but her courage did not fail her. With a\\ncheek flushed by hope, and an eye straining with curiosity, her fingers\\ngrasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth. It was entirely empty.\\nWith less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second, a third, a\\nfourth; each was equally empty. Not one was left unsearched, and in not\\none was anything found. Well read in the art of concealing a treasure,\\nthe possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her, and\\nshe felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain. The place in the\\nmiddle alone remained now unexplored; and though she had \"never from\\nthe first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the\\ncabinet, and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus\\nfar, it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was\\nabout it.\" It was some time however before she could unfasten the door,\\nthe same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of\\nthe outer; but at length it did open; and not vain, as hitherto, was her\\nsearch; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back\\ninto the further part of the cavity, apparently for concealment, and\\nher feelings at that moment were indescribable. Her heart fluttered, her\\nknees trembled, and her cheeks grew pale. She seized, with an unsteady\\nhand, the precious manuscript, for half a glance sufficed to ascertain\\nwritten characters; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations\\nthis striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold, resolved\\ninstantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest.\\n\\nThe dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with\\nalarm; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction; it had yet some\\nhours to burn; and that she might not have any greater difficulty in\\ndistinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion,\\nshe hastily snuffed it. Alas! It was snuffed and extinguished in one. A\\nlamp could not have expired with more awful effect. Catherine, for a\\nfew moments, was motionless with horror. It was done completely; not a\\nremnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath.\\nDarkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room. A violent gust\\nof wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the moment.\\nCatherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which succeeded, a\\nsound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck\\non her affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more. A cold sweat\\nstood on her forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand, and groping\\nher way to the bed, she jumped hastily in, and sought some suspension of\\nagony by creeping far underneath the clothes. To close her eyes in\\nsleep that night, she felt must be entirely out of the question. With\\na curiosity so justly awakened, and feelings in every way so agitated,\\nrepose must be absolutely impossible. The storm too abroad so dreadful!\\nShe had not been used to feel alarm from wind, but now every blast\\nseemed fraught with awful intelligence. The manuscript so wonderfully\\nfound, so wonderfully accomplishing the morning's prediction, how was it\\nto be accounted for? What could it contain? To whom could it relate?\\nBy what means could it have been so long concealed? And how singularly\\nstrange that it should fall to her lot to discover it! Till she had made\\nherself mistress of its contents, however, she could have neither repose\\nnor comfort; and with the sun's first rays she was determined to peruse\\nit. But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene. She\\nshuddered, tossed about in her bed, and envied every quiet sleeper. The\\nstorm still raged, and various were the noises, more terrific even\\nthan the wind, which struck at intervals on her startled ear. The very\\ncurtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at another\\nthe lock of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to\\nenter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than\\nonce her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans. Hour after\\nhour passed away, and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed\\nby all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she\\nunknowingly fell fast asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 22\\n\\n\\nThe housemaid's folding back her window-shutters at eight o'clock the\\nnext day was the sound which first roused Catherine; and she opened her\\neyes, wondering that they could ever have been closed, on objects of\\ncheerfulness; her fire was already burning, and a bright morning\\nhad succeeded the tempest of the night. Instantaneously, with the\\nconsciousness of existence, returned her recollection of the manuscript;\\nand springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid's going away,\\nshe eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the\\nroll on its falling to the ground, and flew back to enjoy the luxury\\nof their perusal on her pillow. She now plainly saw that she must not\\nexpect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she had\\nshuddered over in books, for the roll, seeming to consist entirely of\\nsmall disjointed sheets, was altogether but of trifling size, and much\\nless than she had supposed it to be at first.\\n\\nHer greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page. She started at its import.\\nCould it be possible, or did not her senses play her false? An inventory\\nof linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that was before\\nher! If the evidence of sight might be trusted, she held a washing-bill\\nin her hand. She seized another sheet, and saw the same articles with\\nlittle variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth presented nothing\\nnew. Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced her in each. Two\\nothers, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely more\\ninteresting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball.\\nAnd the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest, seemed by its first\\ncramp line, \"To poultice chestnut mare\"--a farrier's bill! Such was the\\ncollection of papers (left perhaps, as she could then suppose, by the\\nnegligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them) which\\nhad filled her with expectation and alarm, and robbed her of half her\\nnight's rest! She felt humbled to the dust. Could not the adventure of\\nthe chest have taught her wisdom? A corner of it, catching her eye as\\nshe lay, seemed to rise up in judgment against her. Nothing could now\\nbe clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies. To suppose that a\\nmanuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in\\na room such as that, so modern, so habitable!--Or that she should be the\\nfirst to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet, the key of which was\\nopen to all!\\n\\nHow could she have so imposed on herself? Heaven forbid that Henry\\nTilney should ever know her folly! And it was in a great measure his\\nown doing, for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his\\ndescription of her adventures, she should never have felt the smallest\\ncuriosity about it. This was the only comfort that occurred. Impatient\\nto get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly, those detestable\\npapers then scattered over the bed, she rose directly, and folding them\\nup as nearly as possible in the same shape as before, returned them\\nto the same spot within the cabinet, with a very hearty wish that no\\nuntoward accident might ever bring them forward again, to disgrace her\\neven with herself.\\n\\nWhy the locks should have been so difficult to open, however, was still\\nsomething remarkable, for she could now manage them with perfect ease.\\nIn this there was surely something mysterious, and she indulged in the\\nflattering suggestion for half a minute, till the possibility of the\\ndoor's having been at first unlocked, and of being herself its fastener,\\ndarted into her head, and cost her another blush.\\n\\nShe got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conduct\\nproduced such unpleasant reflections, and found her way with all speed\\nto the breakfast-parlour, as it had been pointed out to her by Miss\\nTilney the evening before. Henry was alone in it; and his immediate hope\\nof her having been undisturbed by the tempest, with an arch reference\\nto the character of the building they inhabited, was rather distressing.\\nFor the world would she not have her weakness suspected, and yet,\\nunequal to an absolute falsehood, was constrained to acknowledge that\\nthe wind had kept her awake a little. \"But we have a charming morning\\nafter it,\" she added, desiring to get rid of the subject; \"and storms\\nand sleeplessness are nothing when they are over. What beautiful\\nhyacinths! I have just learnt to love a hyacinth.\"\\n\\n\"And how might you learn? By accident or argument?\"\\n\\n\"Your sister taught me; I cannot tell how. Mrs. Allen used to take\\npains, year after year, to make me like them; but I never could, till\\nI saw them the other day in Milsom Street; I am naturally indifferent\\nabout flowers.\"\\n\\n\"But now you love a hyacinth. So much the better. You have gained a new\\nsource of enjoyment, and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness\\nas possible. Besides, a taste for flowers is always desirable in your\\nsex, as a means of getting you out of doors, and tempting you to more\\nfrequent exercise than you would otherwise take. And though the love\\nof a hyacinth may be rather domestic, who can tell, the sentiment once\\nraised, but you may in time come to love a rose?\"\\n\\n\"But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors. The pleasure\\nof walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me, and in fine weather\\nI am out more than half my time. Mamma says I am never within.\"\\n\\n\"At any rate, however, I am pleased that you have learnt to love\\na hyacinth. The mere habit of learning to love is the thing; and a\\nteachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing. Has my\\nsister a pleasant mode of instruction?\"\\n\\nCatherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the\\nentrance of the general, whose smiling compliments announced a happy\\nstate of mind, but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not\\nadvance her composure.\\n\\nThe elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine's notice\\nwhen they were seated at table; and, luckily, it had been the general's\\nchoice. He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste, confessed it\\nto be neat and simple, thought it right to encourage the manufacture of\\nhis country; and for his part, to his uncritical palate, the tea was as\\nwell flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire, as from that of Dresden\\nor Save. But this was quite an old set, purchased two years ago.\\nThe manufacture was much improved since that time; he had seen some\\nbeautiful specimens when last in town, and had he not been perfectly\\nwithout vanity of that kind, might have been tempted to order a new\\nset. He trusted, however, that an opportunity might ere long occur of\\nselecting one--though not for himself. Catherine was probably the only\\none of the party who did not understand him.\\n\\nShortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston, where business\\nrequired and would keep him two or three days. They all attended in\\nthe hall to see him mount his horse, and immediately on re-entering the\\nbreakfast-room, Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching\\nanother glimpse of his figure. \"This is a somewhat heavy call upon your\\nbrother's fortitude,\" observed the general to Eleanor. \"Woodston will\\nmake but a sombre appearance today.\"\\n\\n\"Is it a pretty place?\" asked Catherine.\\n\\n\"What say you, Eleanor? Speak your opinion, for ladies can best tell the\\ntaste of ladies in regard to places as well as men. I think it would be\\nacknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations. The\\nhouse stands among fine meadows facing the south-east, with an excellent\\nkitchen-garden in the same aspect; the walls surrounding which I built\\nand stocked myself about ten years ago, for the benefit of my son. It\\nis a family living, Miss Morland; and the property in the place being\\nchiefly my own, you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad\\none. Did Henry's income depend solely on this living, he would not be\\nill-provided for. Perhaps it may seem odd, that with only two younger\\nchildren, I should think any profession necessary for him; and certainly\\nthere are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie\\nof business. But though I may not exactly make converts of you young\\nladies, I am sure your father, Miss Morland, would agree with me in\\nthinking it expedient to give every young man some employment. The\\nmoney is nothing, it is not an object, but employment is the thing.\\nEven Frederick, my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit as\\nconsiderable a landed property as any private man in the county, has his\\nprofession.\"\\n\\nThe imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes. The\\nsilence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable.\\n\\nSomething had been said the evening before of her being shown over the\\nhouse, and he now offered himself as her conductor; and though Catherine\\nhad hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter, it was a\\nproposal of too much happiness in itself, under any circumstances, not\\nto be gladly accepted; for she had been already eighteen hours in the\\nabbey, and had seen only a few of its rooms. The netting-box, just\\nleisurely drawn forth, was closed with joyful haste, and she was ready\\nto attend him in a moment. \"And when they had gone over the house, he\\npromised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the\\nshrubberies and garden.\" She curtsied her acquiescence. \"But perhaps\\nit might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object.\\nThe weather was at present favourable, and at this time of year the\\nuncertainty was very great of its continuing so. Which would she prefer?\\nHe was equally at her service. Which did his daughter think would most\\naccord with her fair friend's wishes? But he thought he could discern.\\nYes, he certainly read in Miss Morland's eyes a judicious desire of\\nmaking use of the present smiling weather. But when did she judge amiss?\\nThe abbey would be always safe and dry. He yielded implicitly, and\\nwould fetch his hat and attend them in a moment.\" He left the room,\\nand Catherine, with a disappointed, anxious face, began to speak of her\\nunwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own\\ninclination, under a mistaken idea of pleasing her; but she was stopped\\nby Miss Tilney's saying, with a little confusion, \"I believe it will be\\nwisest to take the morning while it is so fine; and do not be uneasy on\\nmy father's account; he always walks out at this time of day.\"\\n\\nCatherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood. Why\\nwas Miss Tilney embarrassed? Could there be any unwillingness on the\\ngeneral's side to show her over the abbey? The proposal was his own. And\\nwas not it odd that he should always take his walk so early? Neither her\\nfather nor Mr. Allen did so. It was certainly very provoking. She was\\nall impatience to see the house, and had scarcely any curiosity about\\nthe grounds. If Henry had been with them indeed! But now she should not\\nknow what was picturesque when she saw it. Such were her thoughts, but\\nshe kept them to herself, and put on her bonnet in patient discontent.\\n\\nShe was struck, however, beyond her expectation, by the grandeur of\\nthe abbey, as she saw it for the first time from the lawn. The whole\\nbuilding enclosed a large court; and two sides of the quadrangle, rich\\nin Gothic ornaments, stood forward for admiration. The remainder was\\nshut off by knolls of old trees, or luxuriant plantations, and the steep\\nwoody hills rising behind, to give it shelter, were beautiful even in\\nthe leafless month of March. Catherine had seen nothing to compare with\\nit; and her feelings of delight were so strong, that without waiting for\\nany better authority, she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise. The\\ngeneral listened with assenting gratitude; and it seemed as if his own\\nestimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour.\\n\\nThe kitchen-garden was to be next admired, and he led the way to it\\nacross a small portion of the park.\\n\\nThe number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could\\nnot listen to without dismay, being more than double the extent of all\\nMr. Allen's, as well as her father's, including church-yard and orchard.\\nThe walls seemed countless in number, endless in length; a village of\\nhot-houses seemed to arise among them, and a whole parish to be at\\nwork within the enclosure. The general was flattered by her looks of\\nsurprise, which told him almost as plainly, as he soon forced her to\\ntell him in words, that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to\\nthem before; and he then modestly owned that, \"without any ambition of\\nthat sort himself--without any solicitude about it--he did believe them\\nto be unrivalled in the kingdom. If he had a hobby-horse, it was that.\\nHe loved a garden. Though careless enough in most matters of eating, he\\nloved good fruit--or if he did not, his friends and children did. There\\nwere great vexations, however, attending such a garden as his. The\\nutmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits. The pinery\\nhad yielded only one hundred in the last year. Mr. Allen, he supposed,\\nmust feel these inconveniences as well as himself.\"\\n\\n\"No, not at all. Mr. Allen did not care about the garden, and never went\\ninto it.\"\\n\\nWith a triumphant smile of self-satisfaction, the general wished he\\ncould do the same, for he never entered his, without being vexed in some\\nway or other, by its falling short of his plan.\\n\\n\"How were Mr. Allen's succession-houses worked?\" describing the nature\\nof his own as they entered them.\\n\\n\"Mr. Allen had only one small hot-house, which Mrs. Allen had the use of\\nfor her plants in winter, and there was a fire in it now and then.\"\\n\\n\"He is a happy man!\" said the general, with a look of very happy\\ncontempt.\\n\\nHaving taken her into every division, and led her under every wall, till\\nshe was heartily weary of seeing and wondering, he suffered the girls\\nat last to seize the advantage of an outer door, and then expressing\\nhis wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the\\ntea-house, proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk, if Miss\\nMorland were not tired. \"But where are you going, Eleanor? Why do you\\nchoose that cold, damp path to it? Miss Morland will get wet. Our best\\nway is across the park.\"\\n\\n\"This is so favourite a walk of mine,\" said Miss Tilney, \"that I always\\nthink it the best and nearest way. But perhaps it may be damp.\"\\n\\nIt was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs;\\nand Catherine, struck by its gloomy aspect, and eager to enter it,\\ncould not, even by the general's disapprobation, be kept from stepping\\nforward. He perceived her inclination, and having again urged the plea\\nof health in vain, was too polite to make further opposition. He excused\\nhimself, however, from attending them: \"The rays of the sun were not too\\ncheerful for him, and he would meet them by another course.\" He turned\\naway; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were\\nrelieved by the separation. The shock, however, being less real than the\\nrelief, offered it no injury; and she began to talk with easy gaiety of\\nthe delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired.\\n\\n\"I am particularly fond of this spot,\" said her companion, with a sigh.\\n\"It was my mother's favourite walk.\"\\n\\nCatherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before,\\nand the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself\\ndirectly in her altered countenance, and in the attentive pause with\\nwhich she waited for something more.\\n\\n\"I used to walk here so often with her!\" added Eleanor; \"though I never\\nloved it then, as I have loved it since. At that time indeed I used to\\nwonder at her choice. But her memory endears it now.\"\\n\\n\"And ought it not,\" reflected Catherine, \"to endear it to her husband?\\nYet the general would not enter it.\" Miss Tilney continuing silent, she\\nventured to say, \"Her death must have been a great affliction!\"\\n\\n\"A great and increasing one,\" replied the other, in a low voice. \"I was\\nonly thirteen when it happened; and though I felt my loss perhaps as\\nstrongly as one so young could feel it, I did not, I could not, then\\nknow what a loss it was.\" She stopped for a moment, and then added, with\\ngreat firmness, \"I have no sister, you know--and though Henry--though my\\nbrothers are very affectionate, and Henry is a great deal here, which I\\nam most thankful for, it is impossible for me not to be often solitary.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure you must miss him very much.\"\\n\\n\"A mother would have been always present. A mother would have been a\\nconstant friend; her influence would have been beyond all other.\"\\n\\n\"Was she a very charming woman? Was she handsome? Was there any picture\\nof her in the abbey? And why had she been so partial to that grove? Was\\nit from dejection of spirits?\"--were questions now eagerly poured forth;\\nthe first three received a ready affirmative, the two others were passed\\nby; and Catherine's interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with\\nevery question, whether answered or not. Of her unhappiness in marriage,\\nshe felt persuaded. The general certainly had been an unkind husband. He\\ndid not love her walk: could he therefore have loved her? And besides,\\nhandsome as he was, there was a something in the turn of his features\\nwhich spoke his not having behaved well to her.\\n\\n\"Her picture, I suppose,\" blushing at the consummate art of her own\\nquestion, \"hangs in your father's room?\"\\n\\n\"No; it was intended for the drawing-room; but my father was\\ndissatisfied with the painting, and for some time it had no place.\\nSoon after her death I obtained it for my own, and hung it in my\\nbed-chamber--where I shall be happy to show it you; it is very like.\"\\nHere was another proof. A portrait--very like--of a departed wife, not\\nvalued by the husband! He must have been dreadfully cruel to her!\\n\\nCatherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the\\nfeelings which, in spite of all his attentions, he had previously\\nexcited; and what had been terror and dislike before, was now absolute\\naversion. Yes, aversion! His cruelty to such a charming woman made him\\nodious to her. She had often read of such characters, characters which\\nMr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn; but here was\\nproof positive of the contrary.\\n\\nShe had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them\\ndirectly upon the general; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation,\\nshe found herself again obliged to walk with him, listen to him, and\\neven to smile when he smiled. Being no longer able, however, to receive\\npleasure from the surrounding objects, she soon began to walk with\\nlassitude; the general perceived it, and with a concern for her health,\\nwhich seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him, was most urgent\\nfor returning with his daughter to the house. He would follow them in\\na quarter of an hour. Again they parted--but Eleanor was called back in\\nhalf a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend round\\nthe abbey till his return. This second instance of his anxiety to delay\\nwhat she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 23\\n\\n\\nAn hour passed away before the general came in, spent, on the part of\\nhis young guest, in no very favourable consideration of his character.\\n\"This lengthened absence, these solitary rambles, did not speak a mind\\nat ease, or a conscience void of reproach.\" At length he appeared; and,\\nwhatever might have been the gloom of his meditations, he could still\\nsmile with them. Miss Tilney, understanding in part her friend's\\ncuriosity to see the house, soon revived the subject; and her father\\nbeing, contrary to Catherine's expectations, unprovided with any\\npretence for further delay, beyond that of stopping five minutes to\\norder refreshments to be in the room by their return, was at last ready\\nto escort them.\\n\\nThey set forward; and, with a grandeur of air, a dignified step,\\nwhich caught the eye, but could not shake the doubts of the well-read\\nCatherine, he led the way across the hall, through the common\\ndrawing-room and one useless antechamber, into a room magnificent both\\nin size and furniture--the real drawing-room, used only with company of\\nconsequence. It was very noble--very grand--very charming!--was all that\\nCatherine had to say, for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned\\nthe colour of the satin; and all minuteness of praise, all praise\\nthat had much meaning, was supplied by the general: the costliness or\\nelegance of any room's fitting-up could be nothing to her; she cared for\\nno furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century. When the\\ngeneral had satisfied his own curiosity, in a close examination of every\\nwell-known ornament, they proceeded into the library, an apartment, in\\nits way, of equal magnificence, exhibiting a collection of books, on\\nwhich an humble man might have looked with pride. Catherine heard,\\nadmired, and wondered with more genuine feeling than before--gathered\\nall that she could from this storehouse of knowledge, by running over\\nthe titles of half a shelf, and was ready to proceed. But suites of\\napartments did not spring up with her wishes. Large as was the building,\\nshe had already visited the greatest part; though, on being told that,\\nwith the addition of the kitchen, the six or seven rooms she had now\\nseen surrounded three sides of the court, she could scarcely believe it,\\nor overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted. It was\\nsome relief, however, that they were to return to the rooms in common\\nuse, by passing through a few of less importance, looking into the\\ncourt, which, with occasional passages, not wholly unintricate,\\nconnected the different sides; and she was further soothed in her\\nprogress by being told that she was treading what had once been a\\ncloister, having traces of cells pointed out, and observing several\\ndoors that were neither opened nor explained to her--by finding herself\\nsuccessively in a billiard-room, and in the general's private apartment,\\nwithout comprehending their connection, or being able to turn aright\\nwhen she left them; and lastly, by passing through a dark little room,\\nowning Henry's authority, and strewed with his litter of books, guns,\\nand greatcoats.\\n\\nFrom the dining-room, of which, though already seen, and always to be\\nseen at five o'clock, the general could not forgo the pleasure of pacing\\nout the length, for the more certain information of Miss Morland, as\\nto what she neither doubted nor cared for, they proceeded by quick\\ncommunication to the kitchen--the ancient kitchen of the convent, rich\\nin the massy walls and smoke of former days, and in the stoves and hot\\nclosets of the present. The general's improving hand had not loitered\\nhere: every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had\\nbeen adopted within this, their spacious theatre; and, when the genius\\nof others had failed, his own had often produced the perfection wanted.\\nHis endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him high\\namong the benefactors of the convent.\\n\\nWith the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey; the\\nfourth side of the quadrangle having, on account of its decaying state,\\nbeen removed by the general's father, and the present erected in its\\nplace. All that was venerable ceased here. The new building was not\\nonly new, but declared itself to be so; intended only for offices, and\\nenclosed behind by stable-yards, no uniformity of architecture had been\\nthought necessary. Catherine could have raved at the hand which had\\nswept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest, for the\\npurposes of mere domestic economy; and would willingly have been spared\\nthe mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen, had the general\\nallowed it; but if he had a vanity, it was in the arrangement of his\\noffices; and as he was convinced that, to a mind like Miss Morland's,\\na view of the accommodations and comforts, by which the labours of her\\ninferiors were softened, must always be gratifying, he should make\\nno apology for leading her on. They took a slight survey of all; and\\nCatherine was impressed, beyond her expectation, by their multiplicity\\nand their convenience. The purposes for which a few shapeless pantries\\nand a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at Fullerton, were\\nhere carried on in appropriate divisions, commodious and roomy. The\\nnumber of servants continually appearing did not strike her less than\\nthe number of their offices. Wherever they went, some pattened girl\\nstopped to curtsy, or some footman in dishabille sneaked off. Yet this\\nwas an abbey! How inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements\\nfrom such as she had read about--from abbeys and castles, in which,\\nthough certainly larger than Northanger, all the dirty work of the house\\nwas to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost. How they could\\nget through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen; and, when Catherine saw\\nwhat was necessary here, she began to be amazed herself.\\n\\nThey returned to the hall, that the chief staircase might be ascended,\\nand the beauty of its wood, and ornaments of rich carving might be\\npointed out: having gained the top, they turned in an opposite direction\\nfrom the gallery in which her room lay, and shortly entered one on\\nthe same plan, but superior in length and breadth. She was here shown\\nsuccessively into three large bed-chambers, with their dressing-rooms,\\nmost completely and handsomely fitted up; everything that money and\\ntaste could do, to give comfort and elegance to apartments, had been\\nbestowed on these; and, being furnished within the last five years, they\\nwere perfect in all that would be generally pleasing, and wanting in all\\nthat could give pleasure to Catherine. As they were surveying the last,\\nthe general, after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters\\nby whom they had at times been honoured, turned with a smiling\\ncountenance to Catherine, and ventured to hope that henceforward some of\\ntheir earliest tenants might be \"our friends from Fullerton.\" She felt\\nthe unexpected compliment, and deeply regretted the impossibility of\\nthinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself, and so full\\nof civility to all her family.\\n\\nThe gallery was terminated by folding doors, which Miss Tilney,\\nadvancing, had thrown open, and passed through, and seemed on the point\\nof doing the same by the first door to the left, in another long reach\\nof gallery, when the general, coming forwards, called her hastily, and,\\nas Catherine thought, rather angrily back, demanding whether she were\\ngoing?--And what was there more to be seen?--Had not Miss Morland\\nalready seen all that could be worth her notice?--And did she not\\nsuppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much\\nexercise? Miss Tilney drew back directly, and the heavy doors were\\nclosed upon the mortified Catherine, who, having seen, in a momentary\\nglance beyond them, a narrower passage, more numerous openings, and\\nsymptoms of a winding staircase, believed herself at last within the\\nreach of something worth her notice; and felt, as she unwillingly paced\\nback the gallery, that she would rather be allowed to examine that end\\nof the house than see all the finery of all the rest. The general's\\nevident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional\\nstimulant. Something was certainly to be concealed; her fancy, though\\nit had trespassed lately once or twice, could not mislead her here;\\nand what that something was, a short sentence of Miss Tilney's, as they\\nfollowed the general at some distance downstairs, seemed to point out:\\n\"I was going to take you into what was my mother's room--the room\\nin which she died--\" were all her words; but few as they were, they\\nconveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine. It was no wonder that the\\ngeneral should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room\\nmust contain; a room in all probability never entered by him since the\\ndreadful scene had passed, which released his suffering wife, and left\\nhim to the stings of conscience.\\n\\nShe ventured, when next alone with Eleanor, to express her wish of being\\npermitted to see it, as well as all the rest of that side of the house;\\nand Eleanor promised to attend her there, whenever they should have a\\nconvenient hour. Catherine understood her: the general must be watched\\nfrom home, before that room could be entered. \"It remains as it was, I\\nsuppose?\" said she, in a tone of feeling.\\n\\n\"Yes, entirely.\"\\n\\n\"And how long ago may it be that your mother died?\"\\n\\n\"She has been dead these nine years.\" And nine years, Catherine knew,\\nwas a trifle of time, compared with what generally elapsed after the\\ndeath of an injured wife, before her room was put to rights.\\n\\n\"You were with her, I suppose, to the last?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Miss Tilney, sighing; \"I was unfortunately from home. Her\\nillness was sudden and short; and, before I arrived it was all over.\"\\n\\nCatherine's blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally\\nsprang from these words. Could it be possible? Could Henry's father--?\\nAnd yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest\\nsuspicions! And, when she saw him in the evening, while she worked\\nwith her friend, slowly pacing the drawing-room for an hour together in\\nsilent thoughtfulness, with downcast eyes and contracted brow, she felt\\nsecure from all possibility of wronging him. It was the air and attitude\\nof a Montoni! What could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a\\nmind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity, in its fearful review\\nof past scenes of guilt? Unhappy man! And the anxiousness of her spirits\\ndirected her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly, as to catch Miss\\nTilney's notice. \"My father,\" she whispered, \"often walks about the room\\nin this way; it is nothing unusual.\"\\n\\n\"So much the worse!\" thought Catherine; such ill-timed exercise was of a\\npiece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks, and boded\\nnothing good.\\n\\nAfter an evening, the little variety and seeming length of which made\\nher peculiarly sensible of Henry's importance among them, she was\\nheartily glad to be dismissed; though it was a look from the general not\\ndesigned for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell.\\nWhen the butler would have lit his master's candle, however, he was\\nforbidden. The latter was not going to retire. \"I have many pamphlets to\\nfinish,\" said he to Catherine, \"before I can close my eyes, and perhaps\\nmay be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are\\nasleep. Can either of us be more meetly employed? My eyes will be\\nblinding for the good of others, and yours preparing by rest for future\\nmischief.\"\\n\\nBut neither the business alleged, nor the magnificent compliment,\\ncould win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must\\noccasion so serious a delay of proper repose. To be kept up for hours,\\nafter the family were in bed, by stupid pamphlets was not very likely.\\nThere must be some deeper cause: something was to be done which could\\nbe done only while the household slept; and the probability that Mrs.\\nTilney yet lived, shut up for causes unknown, and receiving from the\\npitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food, was the\\nconclusion which necessarily followed. Shocking as was the idea, it\\nwas at least better than a death unfairly hastened, as, in the natural\\ncourse of things, she must ere long be released. The suddenness of her\\nreputed illness, the absence of her daughter, and probably of her other\\nchildren, at the time--all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment.\\nIts origin--jealousy perhaps, or wanton cruelty--was yet to be\\nunravelled.\\n\\nIn revolving these matters, while she undressed, it suddenly struck her\\nas not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the very\\nspot of this unfortunate woman's confinement--might have been within\\na few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days; for what\\npart of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which\\nyet bore the traces of monastic division? In the high-arched passage,\\npaved with stone, which already she had trodden with peculiar awe, she\\nwell remembered the doors of which the general had given no account. To\\nwhat might not those doors lead? In support of the plausibility of this\\nconjecture, it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery, in\\nwhich lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney, must be, as\\ncertainly as her memory could guide her, exactly over this suspected\\nrange of cells, and the staircase by the side of those apartments of\\nwhich she had caught a transient glimpse, communicating by some\\nsecret means with those cells, might well have favoured the barbarous\\nproceedings of her husband. Down that staircase she had perhaps been\\nconveyed in a state of well-prepared insensibility!\\n\\nCatherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises, and\\nsometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far; but they were\\nsupported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible.\\n\\nThe side of the quadrangle, in which she supposed the guilty scene to be\\nacting, being, according to her belief, just opposite her own, it struck\\nher that, if judiciously watched, some rays of light from the general's\\nlamp might glimmer through the lower windows, as he passed to the prison\\nof his wife; and, twice before she stepped into bed, she stole gently\\nfrom her room to the corresponding window in the gallery, to see if it\\nappeared; but all abroad was dark, and it must yet be too early. The\\nvarious ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be\\nup. Till midnight, she supposed it would be in vain to watch; but then,\\nwhen the clock had struck twelve, and all was quiet, she would, if not\\nquite appalled by darkness, steal out and look once more. The clock\\nstruck twelve--and Catherine had been half an hour asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 24\\n\\n\\nThe next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the\\nmysterious apartments. It was Sunday, and the whole time between morning\\nand afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or\\neating cold meat at home; and great as was Catherine's curiosity, her\\ncourage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner, either\\nby the fading light of the sky between six and seven o'clock, or by the\\nyet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp.\\nThe day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination\\nbeyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs.\\nTilney, which immediately fronted the family pew. By that her eye\\nwas instantly caught and long retained; and the perusal of the highly\\nstrained epitaph, in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the\\ninconsolable husband, who must have been in some way or other her\\ndestroyer, affected her even to tears.\\n\\nThat the general, having erected such a monument, should be able to face\\nit, was not perhaps very strange, and yet that he could sit so boldly\\ncollected within its view, maintain so elevated an air, look so\\nfearlessly around, nay, that he should even enter the church, seemed\\nwonderful to Catherine. Not, however, that many instances of beings\\nequally hardened in guilt might not be produced. She could remember\\ndozens who had persevered in every possible vice, going on from crime to\\ncrime, murdering whomsoever they chose, without any feeling of humanity\\nor remorse; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their\\nblack career. The erection of the monument itself could not in the\\nsmallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney's actual decease. Were\\nshe even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed\\nto slumber, were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to\\nbe enclosed--what could it avail in such a case? Catherine had read too\\nmuch not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure\\nmight be introduced, and a supposititious funeral carried on.\\n\\nThe succeeding morning promised something better. The general's early\\nwalk, ill-timed as it was in every other view, was favourable here; and\\nwhen she knew him to be out of the house, she directly proposed to Miss\\nTilney the accomplishment of her promise. Eleanor was ready to oblige\\nher; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise, their\\nfirst visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed-chamber. It\\nrepresented a very lovely woman, with a mild and pensive countenance,\\njustifying, so far, the expectations of its new observer; but they were\\nnot in every respect answered, for Catherine had depended upon meeting\\nwith features, hair, complexion, that should be the very counterpart,\\nthe very image, if not of Henry's, of Eleanor's--the only portraits of\\nwhich she had been in the habit of thinking, bearing always an equal\\nresemblance of mother and child. A face once taken was taken for\\ngenerations. But here she was obliged to look and consider and study\\nfor a likeness. She contemplated it, however, in spite of this drawback,\\nwith much emotion, and, but for a yet stronger interest, would have left\\nit unwillingly.\\n\\nHer agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any\\nendeavour at discourse; she could only look at her companion. Eleanor's\\ncountenance was dejected, yet sedate; and its composure spoke her inured\\nto all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing. Again she passed\\nthrough the folding doors, again her hand was upon the important lock,\\nand Catherine, hardly able to breathe, was turning to close the former\\nwith fearful caution, when the figure, the dreaded figure of the general\\nhimself at the further end of the gallery, stood before her! The name of\\n\"Eleanor\" at the same moment, in his loudest tone, resounded through the\\nbuilding, giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence,\\nand to Catherine terror upon terror. An attempt at concealment had been\\nher first instinctive movement on perceiving him, yet she could\\nscarcely hope to have escaped his eye; and when her friend, who with an\\napologizing look darted hastily by her, had joined and disappeared\\nwith him, she ran for safety to her own room, and, locking herself\\nin, believed that she should never have courage to go down again. She\\nremained there at least an hour, in the greatest agitation, deeply\\ncommiserating the state of her poor friend, and expecting a summons\\nherself from the angry general to attend him in his own apartment. No\\nsummons, however, arrived; and at last, on seeing a carriage drive up\\nto the abbey, she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the\\nprotection of visitors. The breakfast-room was gay with company; and\\nshe was named to them by the general as the friend of his daughter, in\\na complimentary style, which so well concealed his resentful ire, as to\\nmake her feel secure at least of life for the present. And Eleanor,\\nwith a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for his\\ncharacter, taking an early occasion of saying to her, \"My father only\\nwanted me to answer a note,\" she began to hope that she had either been\\nunseen by the general, or that from some consideration of policy she\\nshould be allowed to suppose herself so. Upon this trust she dared still\\nto remain in his presence, after the company left them, and nothing\\noccurred to disturb it.\\n\\nIn the course of this morning's reflections, she came to a resolution\\nof making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone. It would be much\\nbetter in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter.\\nTo involve her in the danger of a second detection, to court her into\\nan apartment which must wring her heart, could not be the office of a\\nfriend. The general's utmost anger could not be to herself what it might\\nbe to a daughter; and, besides, she thought the examination itself\\nwould be more satisfactory if made without any companion. It would be\\nimpossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions, from which the other\\nhad, in all likelihood, been hitherto happily exempt; nor could she\\ntherefore, in her presence, search for those proofs of the general's\\ncruelty, which however they might yet have escaped discovery, she felt\\nconfident of somewhere drawing forth, in the shape of some fragmented\\njournal, continued to the last gasp. Of the way to the apartment she was\\nnow perfectly mistress; and as she wished to get it over before Henry's\\nreturn, who was expected on the morrow, there was no time to be lost.\\nThe day was bright, her courage high; at four o'clock, the sun was now\\ntwo hours above the horizon, and it would be only her retiring to dress\\nhalf an hour earlier than usual.\\n\\nIt was done; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the\\nclocks had ceased to strike. It was no time for thought; she hurried\\non, slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors,\\nand without stopping to look or breathe, rushed forward to the one in\\nquestion. The lock yielded to her hand, and, luckily, with no sullen\\nsound that could alarm a human being. On tiptoe she entered; the room\\nwas before her; but it was some minutes before she could advance another\\nstep. She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature.\\nShe saw a large, well-proportioned apartment, an handsome dimity bed,\\narranged as unoccupied with an housemaid's care, a bright Bath stove,\\nmahogany wardrobes, and neatly painted chairs, on which the warm beams\\nof a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows! Catherine had\\nexpected to have her feelings worked, and worked they were. Astonishment\\nand doubt first seized them; and a shortly succeeding ray of common\\nsense added some bitter emotions of shame. She could not be mistaken\\nas to the room; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!--in Miss\\nTilney's meaning, in her own calculation! This apartment, to which she\\nhad given a date so ancient, a position so awful, proved to be one end\\nof what the general's father had built. There were two other doors in\\nthe chamber, leading probably into dressing-closets; but she had no\\ninclination to open either. Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last\\nwalked, or the volume in which she had last read, remain to tell what\\nnothing else was allowed to whisper? No: whatever might have been the\\ngeneral's crimes, he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for\\ndetection. She was sick of exploring, and desired but to be safe in her\\nown room, with her own heart only privy to its folly; and she was on\\nthe point of retreating as softly as she had entered, when the sound of\\nfootsteps, she could hardly tell where, made her pause and tremble.\\nTo be found there, even by a servant, would be unpleasant; but by the\\ngeneral (and he seemed always at hand when least wanted), much worse!\\nShe listened--the sound had ceased; and resolving not to lose a\\nmoment, she passed through and closed the door. At that instant a door\\nunderneath was hastily opened; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend\\nthe stairs, by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could\\ngain the gallery. She had no power to move. With a feeling of terror\\nnot very definable, she fixed her eyes on the staircase, and in a few\\nmoments it gave Henry to her view. \"Mr. Tilney!\" she exclaimed in a\\nvoice of more than common astonishment. He looked astonished too. \"Good\\nGod!\" she continued, not attending to his address. \"How came you here?\\nHow came you up that staircase?\"\\n\\n\"How came I up that staircase!\" he replied, greatly surprised. \"Because\\nit is my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber; and why\\nshould I not come up it?\"\\n\\nCatherine recollected herself, blushed deeply, and could say no more. He\\nseemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her\\nlips did not afford. She moved on towards the gallery. \"And may I not,\\nin my turn,\" said he, as he pushed back the folding doors, \"ask how you\\ncame here? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the\\nbreakfast-parlour to your apartment, as that staircase can be from the\\nstables to mine.\"\\n\\n\"I have been,\" said Catherine, looking down, \"to see your mother's\\nroom.\"\\n\\n\"My mother's room! Is there anything extraordinary to be seen there?\"\\n\\n\"No, nothing at all. I thought you did not mean to come back till\\ntomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"I did not expect to be able to return sooner, when I went away; but\\nthree hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me. You\\nlook pale. I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs.\\nPerhaps you did not know--you were not aware of their leading from the\\noffices in common use?\"\\n\\n\"No, I was not. You have had a very fine day for your ride.\"\\n\\n\"Very; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in\\nthe house by yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! No; she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday--and we were\\ncoming here to these rooms--but only\"--dropping her voice--\"your father\\nwas with us.\"\\n\\n\"And that prevented you,\" said Henry, earnestly regarding her. \"Have you\\nlooked into all the rooms in that passage?\"\\n\\n\"No, I only wanted to see--Is not it very late? I must go and dress.\"\\n\\n\"It is only a quarter past four\" showing his watch--\"and you are not now\\nin Bath. No theatre, no rooms to prepare for. Half an hour at Northanger\\nmust be enough.\"\\n\\nShe could not contradict it, and therefore suffered herself to be\\ndetained, though her dread of further questions made her, for the first\\ntime in their acquaintance, wish to leave him. They walked slowly up the\\ngallery. \"Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you?\"\\n\\n\"No, and I am very much surprised. Isabella promised so faithfully to\\nwrite directly.\"\\n\\n\"Promised so faithfully! A faithful promise! That puzzles me. I have\\nheard of a faithful performance. But a faithful promise--the fidelity\\nof promising! It is a power little worth knowing, however, since it can\\ndeceive and pain you. My mother's room is very commodious, is it not?\\nLarge and cheerful-looking, and the dressing-closets so well disposed!\\nIt always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house, and\\nI rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own. She sent\\nyou to look at it, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"It has been your own doing entirely?\" Catherine said nothing. After a\\nshort silence, during which he had closely observed her, he added, \"As\\nthere is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity, this must\\nhave proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother's character,\\nas described by Eleanor, which does honour to her memory. The world, I\\nbelieve, never saw a better woman. But it is not often that virtue can\\nboast an interest such as this. The domestic, unpretending merits of a\\nperson never known do not often create that kind of fervent, venerating\\ntenderness which would prompt a visit like yours. Eleanor, I suppose,\\nhas talked of her a great deal?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a great deal. That is--no, not much, but what she did say was very\\ninteresting. Her dying so suddenly\" (slowly, and with hesitation it\\nwas spoken), \"and you--none of you being at home--and your father, I\\nthought--perhaps had not been very fond of her.\"\\n\\n\"And from these circumstances,\" he replied (his quick eye\\nfixed on hers), \"you infer perhaps the probability of some\\nnegligence--some\"--(involuntarily she shook her head)--\"or it may be--of\\nsomething still less pardonable.\" She raised her eyes towards him\\nmore fully than she had ever done before. \"My mother's illness,\" he\\ncontinued, \"the seizure which ended in her death, was sudden. The malady\\nitself, one from which she had often suffered, a bilious fever--its\\ncause therefore constitutional. On the third day, in short, as soon as\\nshe could be prevailed on, a physician attended her, a very respectable\\nman, and one in whom she had always placed great confidence. Upon his\\nopinion of her danger, two others were called in the next day, and\\nremained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours. On the\\nfifth day she died. During the progress of her disorder, Frederick and I\\n(we were both at home) saw her repeatedly; and from our own observation\\ncan bear witness to her having received every possible attention\\nwhich could spring from the affection of those about her, or which her\\nsituation in life could command. Poor Eleanor was absent, and at such a\\ndistance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin.\"\\n\\n\"But your father,\" said Catherine, \"was he afflicted?\"\\n\\n\"For a time, greatly so. You have erred in supposing him not attached\\nto her. He loved her, I am persuaded, as well as it was possible for him\\nto--we have not all, you know, the same tenderness of disposition--and\\nI will not pretend to say that while she lived, she might not often have\\nhad much to bear, but though his temper injured her, his judgment never\\ndid. His value of her was sincere; and, if not permanently, he was truly\\nafflicted by her death.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad of it,\" said Catherine; \"it would have been very\\nshocking!\"\\n\\n\"If I understand you rightly, you had formed a surmise of such horror as\\nI have hardly words to--Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature\\nof the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from?\\nRemember the country and the age in which we live. Remember that we are\\nEnglish, that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding, your\\nown sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing\\naround you. Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do our\\nlaws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated without being known, in\\na country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such a\\nfooting, where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary\\nspies, and where roads and newspapers lay everything open? Dearest Miss\\nMorland, what ideas have you been admitting?\"\\n\\nThey had reached the end of the gallery, and with tears of shame she ran\\noff to her own room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 25\\n\\n\\nThe visions of romance were over. Catherine was completely awakened.\\nHenry's address, short as it had been, had more thoroughly opened her\\neyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several\\ndisappointments had done. Most grievously was she humbled. Most bitterly\\ndid she cry. It was not only with herself that she was sunk--but with\\nHenry. Her folly, which now seemed even criminal, was all exposed to\\nhim, and he must despise her forever. The liberty which her imagination\\nhad dared to take with the character of his father--could he ever\\nforgive it? The absurdity of her curiosity and her fears--could they\\never be forgotten? She hated herself more than she could express. He\\nhad--she thought he had, once or twice before this fatal morning, shown\\nsomething like affection for her. But now--in short, she made herself as\\nmiserable as possible for about half an hour, went down when the\\nclock struck five, with a broken heart, and could scarcely give an\\nintelligible answer to Eleanor's inquiry if she was well. The formidable\\nHenry soon followed her into the room, and the only difference in his\\nbehaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual.\\nCatherine had never wanted comfort more, and he looked as if he was\\naware of it.\\n\\nThe evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness; and\\nher spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity. She did not\\nlearn either to forget or defend the past; but she learned to hope that\\nit would never transpire farther, and that it might not cost her Henry's\\nentire regard. Her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had\\nwith such causeless terror felt and done, nothing could shortly be\\nclearer than that it had been all a voluntary, self-created delusion,\\neach trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination\\nresolved on alarm, and everything forced to bend to one purpose by\\na mind which, before she entered the abbey, had been craving to be\\nfrightened. She remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a\\nknowledge of Northanger. She saw that the infatuation had been created,\\nthe mischief settled, long before her quitting Bath, and it seemed as if\\nthe whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which\\nshe had there indulged.\\n\\nCharming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe's works, and charming even as were\\nthe works of all her imitators, it was not in them perhaps that human\\nnature, at least in the Midland counties of England, was to be looked\\nfor. Of the Alps and Pyrenees, with their pine forests and their vices,\\nthey might give a faithful delineation; and Italy, Switzerland, and\\nthe south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there\\nrepresented. Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country, and even\\nof that, if hard pressed, would have yielded the northern and western\\nextremities. But in the central part of England there was surely some\\nsecurity for the existence even of a wife not beloved, in the laws of\\nthe land, and the manners of the age. Murder was not tolerated, servants\\nwere not slaves, and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured,\\nlike rhubarb, from every druggist. Among the Alps and Pyrenees, perhaps,\\nthere were no mixed characters. There, such as were not as spotless as\\nan angel might have the dispositions of a fiend. But in England it was\\nnot so; among the English, she believed, in their hearts and habits,\\nthere was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad. Upon this\\nconviction, she would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor\\nTilney, some slight imperfection might hereafter appear; and upon this\\nconviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in\\nthe character of their father, who, though cleared from the grossly\\ninjurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained, she\\ndid believe, upon serious consideration, to be not perfectly amiable.\\n\\nHer mind made up on these several points, and her resolution formed, of\\nalways judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense, she\\nhad nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever; and\\nthe lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in\\nthe course of another day. Henry's astonishing generosity and nobleness\\nof conduct, in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed,\\nwas of the greatest assistance to her; and sooner than she could have\\nsupposed it possible in the beginning of her distress, her spirits\\nbecame absolutely comfortable, and capable, as heretofore, of continual\\nimprovement by anything he said. There were still some subjects, indeed,\\nunder which she believed they must always tremble--the mention of a\\nchest or a cabinet, for instance--and she did not love the sight of\\njapan in any shape: but even she could allow that an occasional memento\\nof past folly, however painful, might not be without use.\\n\\nThe anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of\\nromance. Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater.\\nShe was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on, and how the\\nrooms were attended; and especially was she anxious to be assured of\\nIsabella's having matched some fine netting-cotton, on which she had\\nleft her intent; and of her continuing on the best terms with James. Her\\nonly dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella. James had\\nprotested against writing to her till his return to Oxford; and Mrs.\\nAllen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to\\nFullerton. But Isabella had promised and promised again; and when she\\npromised a thing, she was so scrupulous in performing it! This made it\\nso particularly strange!\\n\\nFor nine successive mornings, Catherine wondered over the repetition\\nof a disappointment, which each morning became more severe: but, on\\nthe tenth, when she entered the breakfast-room, her first object was a\\nletter, held out by Henry's willing hand. She thanked him as heartily\\nas if he had written it himself. \"'Tis only from James, however,\" as she\\nlooked at the direction. She opened it; it was from Oxford; and to this\\npurpose:\\n\\n\\n\"Dear Catherine,\\n\\n\"Though, God knows, with little inclination for writing, I think it my\\nduty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and\\nme. I left her and Bath yesterday, never to see either again. I shall\\nnot enter into particulars--they would only pain you more. You will soon\\nhear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame; and I\\nhope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily\\nthinking his affection returned. Thank God! I am undeceived in time!\\nBut it is a heavy blow! After my father's consent had been so kindly\\ngiven--but no more of this. She has made me miserable forever! Let me\\nsoon hear from you, dear Catherine; you are my only friend; your love\\nI do build upon. I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before\\nCaptain Tilney makes his engagement known, or you will be uncomfortably\\ncircumstanced. Poor Thorpe is in town: I dread the sight of him; his\\nhonest heart would feel so much. I have written to him and my father.\\nHer duplicity hurts me more than all; till the very last, if I reasoned\\nwith her, she declared herself as much attached to me as ever, and\\nlaughed at my fears. I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it;\\nbut if ever man had reason to believe himself loved, I was that man. I\\ncannot understand even now what she would be at, for there could be no\\nneed of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney. We parted\\nat last by mutual consent--happy for me had we never met! I can never\\nexpect to know such another woman! Dearest Catherine, beware how you\\ngive your heart.\\n\\n\"Believe me,\" &c.\\n\\n\\nCatherine had not read three lines before her sudden change of\\ncountenance, and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder, declared her to\\nbe receiving unpleasant news; and Henry, earnestly watching her through\\nthe whole letter, saw plainly that it ended no better than it began. He\\nwas prevented, however, from even looking his surprise by his father's\\nentrance. They went to breakfast directly; but Catherine could hardly\\neat anything. Tears filled her eyes, and even ran down her cheeks as she\\nsat. The letter was one moment in her hand, then in her lap, and then in\\nher pocket; and she looked as if she knew not what she did. The general,\\nbetween his cocoa and his newspaper, had luckily no leisure for noticing\\nher; but to the other two her distress was equally visible. As soon\\nas she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room; but the\\nhousemaids were busy in it, and she was obliged to come down again.\\nShe turned into the drawing-room for privacy, but Henry and Eleanor had\\nlikewise retreated thither, and were at that moment deep in consultation\\nabout her. She drew back, trying to beg their pardon, but was, with\\ngentle violence, forced to return; and the others withdrew, after\\nEleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort\\nto her.\\n\\nAfter half an hour's free indulgence of grief and reflection, Catherine\\nfelt equal to encountering her friends; but whether she should make\\nher distress known to them was another consideration. Perhaps, if\\nparticularly questioned, she might just give an idea--just distantly\\nhint at it--but not more. To expose a friend, such a friend as Isabella\\nhad been to her--and then their own brother so closely concerned in it!\\nShe believed she must waive the subject altogether. Henry and Eleanor\\nwere by themselves in the breakfast-room; and each, as she entered it,\\nlooked at her anxiously. Catherine took her place at the table, and,\\nafter a short silence, Eleanor said, \"No bad news from Fullerton, I\\nhope? Mr. and Mrs. Morland--your brothers and sisters--I hope they are\\nnone of them ill?\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you\" (sighing as she spoke); \"they are all very well. My\\nletter was from my brother at Oxford.\"\\n\\nNothing further was said for a few minutes; and then speaking through\\nher tears, she added, \"I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter\\nagain!\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry,\" said Henry, closing the book he had just opened; \"if I\\nhad suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome, I should have\\ngiven it with very different feelings.\"\\n\\n\"It contained something worse than anybody could suppose! Poor James is\\nso unhappy! You will soon know why.\"\\n\\n\"To have so kind-hearted, so affectionate a sister,\" replied Henry\\nwarmly, \"must be a comfort to him under any distress.\"\\n\\n\"I have one favour to beg,\" said Catherine, shortly afterwards, in an\\nagitated manner, \"that, if your brother should be coming here, you will\\ngive me notice of it, that I may go away.\"\\n\\n\"Our brother! Frederick!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon, but\\nsomething has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in\\nthe same house with Captain Tilney.\"\\n\\nEleanor's work was suspended while she gazed with increasing\\nastonishment; but Henry began to suspect the truth, and something, in\\nwhich Miss Thorpe's name was included, passed his lips.\\n\\n\"How quick you are!\" cried Catherine: \"you have guessed it, I declare!\\nAnd yet, when we talked about it in Bath, you little thought of its\\nending so. Isabella--no wonder now I have not heard from her--Isabella\\nhas deserted my brother, and is to marry yours! Could you have believed\\nthere had been such inconstancy and fickleness, and everything that is\\nbad in the world?\"\\n\\n\"I hope, so far as concerns my brother, you are misinformed. I hope\\nhe has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland's\\ndisappointment. His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable. I think you\\nmust be deceived so far. I am very sorry for Mr. Morland--sorry that\\nanyone you love should be unhappy; but my surprise would be greater at\\nFrederick's marrying her than at any other part of the story.\"\\n\\n\"It is very true, however; you shall read James's letter yourself.\\nStay--There is one part--\" recollecting with a blush the last line.\\n\\n\"Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern\\nmy brother?\"\\n\\n\"No, read it yourself,\" cried Catherine, whose second thoughts were\\nclearer. \"I do not know what I was thinking of\" (blushing again that she\\nhad blushed before); \"James only means to give me good advice.\"\\n\\nHe gladly received the letter, and, having read it through, with close\\nattention, returned it saying, \"Well, if it is to be so, I can only\\nsay that I am sorry for it. Frederick will not be the first man who has\\nchosen a wife with less sense than his family expected. I do not envy\\nhis situation, either as a lover or a son.\"\\n\\nMiss Tilney, at Catherine's invitation, now read the letter likewise,\\nand, having expressed also her concern and surprise, began to inquire\\ninto Miss Thorpe's connections and fortune.\\n\\n\"Her mother is a very good sort of woman,\" was Catherine's answer.\\n\\n\"What was her father?\"\\n\\n\"A lawyer, I believe. They live at Putney.\"\\n\\n\"Are they a wealthy family?\"\\n\\n\"No, not very. I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all: but\\nthat will not signify in your family. Your father is so very liberal!\\nHe told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to\\npromote the happiness of his children.\" The brother and sister looked\\nat each other. \"But,\" said Eleanor, after a short pause, \"would it be to\\npromote his happiness, to enable him to marry such a girl? She must be\\nan unprincipled one, or she could not have used your brother so. And how\\nstrange an infatuation on Frederick's side! A girl who, before his eyes,\\nis violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man! Is\\nnot it inconceivable, Henry? Frederick too, who always wore his heart so\\nproudly! Who found no woman good enough to be loved!\"\\n\\n\"That is the most unpromising circumstance, the strongest presumption\\nagainst him. When I think of his past declarations, I give him up.\\nMoreover, I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe's prudence to\\nsuppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other\\nwas secured. It is all over with Frederick indeed! He is a deceased\\nman--defunct in understanding. Prepare for your sister-in-law, Eleanor,\\nand such a sister-in-law as you must delight in! Open, candid, artless,\\nguileless, with affections strong but simple, forming no pretensions,\\nand knowing no disguise.\"\\n\\n\"Such a sister-in-law, Henry, I should delight in,\" said Eleanor with a\\nsmile.\\n\\n\"But perhaps,\" observed Catherine, \"though she has behaved so ill by our\\nfamily, she may behave better by yours. Now she has really got the man\\nshe likes, she may be constant.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I am afraid she will,\" replied Henry; \"I am afraid she will\\nbe very constant, unless a baronet should come in her way; that is\\nFrederick's only chance. I will get the Bath paper, and look over the\\narrivals.\"\\n\\n\"You think it is all for ambition, then? And, upon my word, there are\\nsome things that seem very like it. I cannot forget that, when she first\\nknew what my father would do for them, she seemed quite disappointed\\nthat it was not more. I never was so deceived in anyone's character in\\nmy life before.\"\\n\\n\"Among all the great variety that you have known and studied.\"\\n\\n\"My own disappointment and loss in her is very great; but, as for poor\\nJames, I suppose he will hardly ever recover it.\"\\n\\n\"Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present; but we\\nmust not, in our concern for his sufferings, undervalue yours. You feel,\\nI suppose, that in losing Isabella, you lose half yourself: you feel a\\nvoid in your heart which nothing else can occupy. Society is becoming\\nirksome; and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at\\nBath, the very idea of them without her is abhorrent. You would not,\\nfor instance, now go to a ball for the world. You feel that you have no\\nlonger any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve, on whose regard\\nyou can place dependence, or whose counsel, in any difficulty, you could\\nrely on. You feel all this?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Catherine, after a few moments' reflection, \"I do not--ought\\nI? To say the truth, though I am hurt and grieved, that I cannot still\\nlove her, that I am never to hear from her, perhaps never to see her\\nagain, I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would have\\nthought.\"\\n\\n\"You feel, as you always do, what is most to the credit of human nature.\\nSuch feelings ought to be investigated, that they may know themselves.\"\\n\\nCatherine, by some chance or other, found her spirits so very much\\nrelieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led\\non, though so unaccountably, to mention the circumstance which had\\nproduced it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 26\\n\\n\\nFrom this time, the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young\\npeople; and Catherine found, with some surprise, that her two young\\nfriends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella's want of\\nconsequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way\\nof her marrying their brother. Their persuasion that the general would,\\nupon this ground alone, independent of the objection that might be\\nraised against her character, oppose the connection, turned her feelings\\nmoreover with some alarm towards herself. She was as insignificant,\\nand perhaps as portionless, as Isabella; and if the heir of the Tilney\\nproperty had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself, at what point\\nof interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest? The very\\npainful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by\\na dependence on the effect of that particular partiality, which, as she\\nwas given to understand by his words as well as his actions, she had\\nfrom the first been so fortunate as to excite in the general; and by a\\nrecollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the\\nsubject of money, which she had more than once heard him utter, and\\nwhich tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood\\nby his children.\\n\\nThey were so fully convinced, however, that their brother would not\\nhave the courage to apply in person for his father's consent, and so\\nrepeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely to\\ncome to Northanger than at the present time, that she suffered her mind\\nto be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own. But\\nas it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney, whenever he made his\\napplication, would give his father any just idea of Isabella's conduct,\\nit occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole\\nbusiness before him as it really was, enabling the general by that means\\nto form a cool and impartial opinion, and prepare his objections on\\na fairer ground than inequality of situations. She proposed it to him\\naccordingly; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had\\nexpected. \"No,\" said he, \"my father's hands need not be strengthened,\\nand Frederick's confession of folly need not be forestalled. He must\\ntell his own story.\"\\n\\n\"But he will tell only half of it.\"\\n\\n\"A quarter would be enough.\"\\n\\nA day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney. His\\nbrother and sister knew not what to think. Sometimes it appeared to\\nthem as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected\\nengagement, and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it.\\nThe general, meanwhile, though offended every morning by Frederick's\\nremissness in writing, was free from any real anxiety about him, and had\\nno more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland's time at\\nNorthanger pass pleasantly. He often expressed his uneasiness on this\\nhead, feared the sameness of every day's society and employments would\\ndisgust her with the place, wished the Lady Frasers had been in the\\ncountry, talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner,\\nand once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing\\npeople in the neighbourhood. But then it was such a dead time of year,\\nno wild-fowl, no game, and the Lady Frasers were not in the country.\\nAnd it all ended, at last, in his telling Henry one morning that when he\\nnext went to Woodston, they would take him by surprise there some day\\nor other, and eat their mutton with him. Henry was greatly honoured and\\nvery happy, and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme. \"And when\\ndo you think, sir, I may look forward to this pleasure? I must be at\\nWoodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting, and shall probably be\\nobliged to stay two or three days.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, we will take our chance some one of those days. There is\\nno need to fix. You are not to put yourself at all out of your way.\\nWhatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough. I think I\\ncan answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor's table.\\nLet me see; Monday will be a busy day with you, we will not come on\\nMonday; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me. I expect my surveyor\\nfrom Brockham with his report in the morning; and afterwards I cannot in\\ndecency fail attending the club. I really could not face my acquaintance\\nif I stayed away now; for, as I am known to be in the country, it would\\nbe taken exceedingly amiss; and it is a rule with me, Miss Morland,\\nnever to give offence to any of my neighbours, if a small sacrifice of\\ntime and attention can prevent it. They are a set of very worthy men.\\nThey have half a buck from Northanger twice a year; and I dine with them\\nwhenever I can. Tuesday, therefore, we may say is out of the question.\\nBut on Wednesday, I think, Henry, you may expect us; and we shall be\\nwith you early, that we may have time to look about us. Two hours and\\nthree quarters will carry us to Woodston, I suppose; we shall be in the\\ncarriage by ten; so, about a quarter before one on Wednesday, you may\\nlook for us.\"\\n\\nA ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than\\nthis little excursion, so strong was her desire to be acquainted with\\nWoodston; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry, about an\\nhour afterwards, came booted and greatcoated into the room where she\\nand Eleanor were sitting, and said, \"I am come, young ladies, in a\\nvery moralizing strain, to observe that our pleasures in this world\\nare always to be paid for, and that we often purchase them at a great\\ndisadvantage, giving ready-monied actual happiness for a draft on the\\nfuture, that may not be honoured. Witness myself, at this present hour.\\nBecause I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on\\nWednesday, which bad weather, or twenty other causes, may prevent, I\\nmust go away directly, two days before I intended it.\"\\n\\n\"Go away!\" said Catherine, with a very long face. \"And why?\"\\n\\n\"Why! How can you ask the question? Because no time is to be lost in\\nfrightening my old housekeeper out of her wits, because I must go and\\nprepare a dinner for you, to be sure.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Not seriously!\"\\n\\n\"Aye, and sadly too--for I had much rather stay.\"\\n\\n\"But how can you think of such a thing, after what the general said?\\nWhen he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble,\\nbecause anything would do.\"\\n\\nHenry only smiled. \"I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister's\\naccount and mine. You must know it to be so; and the general made such\\na point of your providing nothing extraordinary: besides, if he had not\\nsaid half so much as he did, he has always such an excellent dinner\\nat home, that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not\\nsignify.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I could reason like you, for his sake and my own. Good-bye. As\\ntomorrow is Sunday, Eleanor, I shall not return.\"\\n\\nHe went; and, it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine\\nto doubt her own judgment than Henry's, she was very soon obliged to\\ngive him credit for being right, however disagreeable to her his going.\\nBut the inexplicability of the general's conduct dwelt much on her\\nthoughts. That he was very particular in his eating, she had, by her own\\nunassisted observation, already discovered; but why he should say\\none thing so positively, and mean another all the while, was most\\nunaccountable! How were people, at that rate, to be understood? Who but\\nHenry could have been aware of what his father was at?\\n\\nFrom Saturday to Wednesday, however, they were now to be without Henry.\\nThis was the sad finale of every reflection: and Captain Tilney's letter\\nwould certainly come in his absence; and Wednesday she was very sure\\nwould be wet. The past, present, and future were all equally in gloom.\\nHer brother so unhappy, and her loss in Isabella so great; and Eleanor's\\nspirits always affected by Henry's absence! What was there to interest\\nor amuse her? She was tired of the woods and the shrubberies--always so\\nsmooth and so dry; and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than\\nany other house. The painful remembrance of the folly it had helped\\nto nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from a\\nconsideration of the building. What a revolution in her ideas! She, who\\nhad so longed to be in an abbey! Now, there was nothing so charming\\nto her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well-connected\\nparsonage, something like Fullerton, but better: Fullerton had its\\nfaults, but Woodston probably had none. If Wednesday should ever come!\\n\\nIt did come, and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for. It\\ncame--it was fine--and Catherine trod on air. By ten o'clock, the chaise\\nand four conveyed the trio from the abbey; and, after an agreeable drive\\nof almost twenty miles, they entered Woodston, a large and populous\\nvillage, in a situation not unpleasant. Catherine was ashamed to say\\nhow pretty she thought it, as the general seemed to think an apology\\nnecessary for the flatness of the country, and the size of the village;\\nbut in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at,\\nand looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of\\na cottage, and at all the little chandler's shops which they passed. At\\nthe further end of the village, and tolerably disengaged from the rest\\nof it, stood the parsonage, a new-built substantial stone house, with\\nits semicircular sweep and green gates; and, as they drove up to the\\ndoor, Henry, with the friends of his solitude, a large Newfoundland\\npuppy and two or three terriers, was ready to receive and make much of\\nthem.\\n\\nCatherine's mind was too full, as she entered the house, for her either\\nto observe or to say a great deal; and, till called on by the general\\nfor her opinion of it, she had very little idea of the room in which she\\nwas sitting. Upon looking round it then, she perceived in a moment that\\nit was the most comfortable room in the world; but she was too guarded\\nto say so, and the coldness of her praise disappointed him.\\n\\n\"We are not calling it a good house,\" said he. \"We are not comparing\\nit with Fullerton and Northanger--we are considering it as a mere\\nparsonage, small and confined, we allow, but decent, perhaps, and\\nhabitable; and altogether not inferior to the generality; or, in other\\nwords, I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so\\ngood. It may admit of improvement, however. Far be it from me to say\\notherwise; and anything in reason--a bow thrown out, perhaps--though,\\nbetween ourselves, if there is one thing more than another my aversion,\\nit is a patched-on bow.\"\\n\\nCatherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained\\nby it; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported\\nby Henry, at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was\\nintroduced by his servant, the general was shortly restored to his\\ncomplacency, and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits.\\n\\nThe room in question was of a commodious, well-proportioned size, and\\nhandsomely fitted up as a dining-parlour; and on their quitting it to\\nwalk round the grounds, she was shown, first into a smaller apartment,\\nbelonging peculiarly to the master of the house, and made unusually tidy\\non the occasion; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing-room,\\nwith the appearance of which, though unfurnished, Catherine was\\ndelighted enough even to satisfy the general. It was a prettily shaped\\nroom, the windows reaching to the ground, and the view from them\\npleasant, though only over green meadows; and she expressed her\\nadmiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she\\nfelt it. \"Oh! Why do not you fit up this room, Mr. Tilney? What a pity\\nnot to have it fitted up! It is the prettiest room I ever saw; it is the\\nprettiest room in the world!\"\\n\\n\"I trust,\" said the general, with a most satisfied smile, \"that it will\\nvery speedily be furnished: it waits only for a lady's taste!\"\\n\\n\"Well, if it was my house, I should never sit anywhere else. Oh! What a\\nsweet little cottage there is among the trees--apple trees, too! It is\\nthe prettiest cottage!\"\\n\\n\"You like it--you approve it as an object--it is enough. Henry, remember\\nthat Robinson is spoken to about it. The cottage remains.\"\\n\\nSuch a compliment recalled all Catherine's consciousness, and silenced\\nher directly; and, though pointedly applied to by the general for her\\nchoice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings, nothing like\\nan opinion on the subject could be drawn from her. The influence of\\nfresh objects and fresh air, however, was of great use in dissipating\\nthese embarrassing associations; and, having reached the ornamental part\\nof the premises, consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow, on\\nwhich Henry's genius had begun to act about half a year ago, she was\\nsufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure-ground she\\nhad ever been in before, though there was not a shrub in it higher than\\nthe green bench in the corner.\\n\\nA saunter into other meadows, and through part of the village, with a\\nvisit to the stables to examine some improvements, and a charming game\\nof play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about, brought them\\nto four o'clock, when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three. At\\nfour they were to dine, and at six to set off on their return. Never had\\nany day passed so quickly!\\n\\nShe could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem\\nto create the smallest astonishment in the general; nay, that he was\\neven looking at the side-table for cold meat which was not there. His\\nson and daughter's observations were of a different kind. They had\\nseldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own, and never\\nbefore known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter's being\\noiled.\\n\\nAt six o'clock, the general having taken his coffee, the carriage again\\nreceived them; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct\\nthroughout the whole visit, so well assured was her mind on the subject\\nof his expectations, that, could she have felt equally confident of the\\nwishes of his son, Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little\\nanxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 27\\n\\n\\nThe next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from\\nIsabella:\\n\\n\\nBath, April\\n\\nMy dearest Catherine, I received your two kind letters with the greatest\\ndelight, and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them\\nsooner. I really am quite ashamed of my idleness; but in this horrid\\nplace one can find time for nothing. I have had my pen in my hand to\\nbegin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath, but have\\nalways been prevented by some silly trifler or other. Pray write to me\\nsoon, and direct to my own home. Thank God, we leave this vile place\\ntomorrow. Since you went away, I have had no pleasure in it--the dust\\nis beyond anything; and everybody one cares for is gone. I believe if I\\ncould see you I should not mind the rest, for you are dearer to me than\\nanybody can conceive. I am quite uneasy about your dear brother, not\\nhaving heard from him since he went to Oxford; and am fearful of some\\nmisunderstanding. Your kind offices will set all right: he is the only\\nman I ever did or could love, and I trust you will convince him of it.\\nThe spring fashions are partly down; and the hats the most frightful you\\ncan imagine. I hope you spend your time pleasantly, but am afraid you\\nnever think of me. I will not say all that I could of the family you are\\nwith, because I would not be ungenerous, or set you against those you\\nesteem; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust, and young men\\nnever know their minds two days together. I rejoice to say that the\\nyoung man whom, of all others, I particularly abhor, has left Bath. You\\nwill know, from this description, I must mean Captain Tilney, who, as\\nyou may remember, was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me, before\\nyou went away. Afterwards he got worse, and became quite my shadow. Many\\ngirls might have been taken in, for never were such attentions; but I\\nknew the fickle sex too well. He went away to his regiment two days ago,\\nand I trust I shall never be plagued with him again. He is the greatest\\ncoxcomb I ever saw, and amazingly disagreeable. The last two days he was\\nalways by the side of Charlotte Davis: I pitied his taste, but took no\\nnotice of him. The last time we met was in Bath Street, and I turned\\ndirectly into a shop that he might not speak to me; I would not even\\nlook at him. He went into the pump-room afterwards; but I would not have\\nfollowed him for all the world. Such a contrast between him and your\\nbrother! Pray send me some news of the latter--I am quite unhappy about\\nhim; he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away, with a cold, or\\nsomething that affected his spirits. I would write to him myself, but\\nhave mislaid his direction; and, as I hinted above, am afraid he\\ntook something in my conduct amiss. Pray explain everything to his\\nsatisfaction; or, if he still harbours any doubt, a line from himself\\nto me, or a call at Putney when next in town, might set all to rights.\\nI have not been to the rooms this age, nor to the play, except going in\\nlast night with the Hodges, for a frolic, at half price: they teased\\nme into it; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up\\nbecause Tilney was gone. We happened to sit by the Mitchells, and they\\npretended to be quite surprised to see me out. I knew their spite: at\\none time they could not be civil to me, but now they are all friendship;\\nbut I am not such a fool as to be taken in by them. You know I have a\\npretty good spirit of my own. Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a\\nturban like mine, as I wore it the week before at the concert, but made\\nwretched work of it--it happened to become my odd face, I believe, at\\nleast Tilney told me so at the time, and said every eye was upon me; but\\nhe is the last man whose word I would take. I wear nothing but purple\\nnow: I know I look hideous in it, but no matter--it is your dear\\nbrother's favourite colour. Lose no time, my dearest, sweetest\\nCatherine, in writing to him and to me, Who ever am, etc.\\n\\n\\nSuch a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine.\\nIts inconsistencies, contradictions, and falsehood struck her from the\\nvery first. She was ashamed of Isabella, and ashamed of having ever\\nloved her. Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her\\nexcuses were empty, and her demands impudent. \"Write to James on her\\nbehalf! No, James should never hear Isabella's name mentioned by her\\nagain.\"\\n\\nOn Henry's arrival from Woodston, she made known to him and Eleanor\\ntheir brother's safety, congratulating them with sincerity on it, and\\nreading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong\\nindignation. When she had finished it--\"So much for Isabella,\" she\\ncried, \"and for all our intimacy! She must think me an idiot, or she\\ncould not have written so; but perhaps this has served to make her\\ncharacter better known to me than mine is to her. I see what she has\\nbeen about. She is a vain coquette, and her tricks have not answered. I\\ndo not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me, and I\\nwish I had never known her.\"\\n\\n\"It will soon be as if you never had,\" said Henry.\\n\\n\"There is but one thing that I cannot understand. I see that she has\\nhad designs on Captain Tilney, which have not succeeded; but I do not\\nunderstand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time. Why should\\nhe pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother, and\\nthen fly off himself?\"\\n\\n\"I have very little to say for Frederick's motives, such as I believe\\nthem to have been. He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe, and the\\nchief difference is, that, having a stronger head, they have not yet\\ninjured himself. If the effect of his behaviour does not justify him\\nwith you, we had better not seek after the cause.\"\\n\\n\"Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her?\"\\n\\n\"I am persuaded that he never did.\"\\n\\n\"And only made believe to do so for mischief's sake?\"\\n\\nHenry bowed his assent.\\n\\n\"Well, then, I must say that I do not like him at all. Though it has\\nturned out so well for us, I do not like him at all. As it happens,\\nthere is no great harm done, because I do not think Isabella has any\\nheart to lose. But, suppose he had made her very much in love with him?\"\\n\\n\"But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to\\nlose--consequently to have been a very different creature; and, in that\\ncase, she would have met with very different treatment.\"\\n\\n\"It is very right that you should stand by your brother.\"\\n\\n\"And if you would stand by yours, you would not be much distressed by\\nthe disappointment of Miss Thorpe. But your mind is warped by an innate\\nprinciple of general integrity, and therefore not accessible to the cool\\nreasonings of family partiality, or a desire of revenge.\"\\n\\nCatherine was complimented out of further bitterness. Frederick could\\nnot be unpardonably guilty, while Henry made himself so agreeable. She\\nresolved on not answering Isabella's letter, and tried to think no more\\nof it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 28\\n\\n\\nSoon after this, the general found himself obliged to go to London for\\na week; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity\\nshould rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland's company, and anxiously\\nrecommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his children\\nas their chief object in his absence. His departure gave Catherine the\\nfirst experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain. The\\nhappiness with which their time now passed, every employment voluntary,\\nevery laugh indulged, every meal a scene of ease and good humour,\\nwalking where they liked and when they liked, their hours, pleasures,\\nand fatigues at their own command, made her thoroughly sensible of the\\nrestraint which the general's presence had imposed, and most thankfully\\nfeel their present release from it. Such ease and such delights made her\\nlove the place and the people more and more every day; and had it not\\nbeen for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one, and\\nan apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other, she would at\\neach moment of each day have been perfectly happy; but she was now in\\nthe fourth week of her visit; before the general came home, the fourth\\nweek would be turned, and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she\\nstayed much longer. This was a painful consideration whenever it\\noccurred; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind, she very\\nsoon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once, propose going away,\\nand be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might\\nbe taken.\\n\\nAware that if she gave herself much time, she might feel it difficult to\\nbring forward so unpleasant a subject, she took the first opportunity of\\nbeing suddenly alone with Eleanor, and of Eleanor's being in the\\nmiddle of a speech about something very different, to start forth her\\nobligation of going away very soon. Eleanor looked and declared herself\\nmuch concerned. She had \"hoped for the pleasure of her company for a\\nmuch longer time--had been misled (perhaps by her wishes) to suppose\\nthat a much longer visit had been promised--and could not but think that\\nif Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have\\nher there, they would be too generous to hasten her return.\" Catherine\\nexplained: \"Oh! As to that, Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all. As\\nlong as she was happy, they would always be satisfied.\"\\n\\n\"Then why, might she ask, in such a hurry herself to leave them?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Because she had been there so long.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, if you can use such a word, I can urge you no farther. If you\\nthink it long--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! No, I do not indeed. For my own pleasure, I could stay with you as\\nlong again.\" And it was directly settled that, till she had, her leaving\\nthem was not even to be thought of. In having this cause of uneasiness\\nso pleasantly removed, the force of the other was likewise weakened. The\\nkindness, the earnestness of Eleanor's manner in pressing her to stay,\\nand Henry's gratified look on being told that her stay was determined,\\nwere such sweet proofs of her importance with them, as left her only\\njust so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably\\nwithout. She did--almost always--believe that Henry loved her, and quite\\nalways that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong\\nto them; and believing so far, her doubts and anxieties were merely\\nsportive irritations.\\n\\nHenry was not able to obey his father's injunction of remaining wholly\\nat Northanger in attendance on the ladies, during his absence in London,\\nthe engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave them on\\nSaturday for a couple of nights. His loss was not now what it had been\\nwhile the general was at home; it lessened their gaiety, but did not\\nruin their comfort; and the two girls agreeing in occupation, and\\nimproving in intimacy, found themselves so well sufficient for the time\\nto themselves, that it was eleven o'clock, rather a late hour at\\nthe abbey, before they quitted the supper-room on the day of Henry's\\ndeparture. They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed,\\nas far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge, that a\\ncarriage was driving up to the door, and the next moment confirmed the\\nidea by the loud noise of the house-bell. After the first perturbation\\nof surprise had passed away, in a \"Good heaven! What can be the matter?\"\\nit was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her eldest brother, whose\\narrival was often as sudden, if not quite so unseasonable, and\\naccordingly she hurried down to welcome him.\\n\\nCatherine walked on to her chamber, making up her mind as well as she\\ncould, to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney, and comforting\\nherself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her, and\\nthe persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of\\nher, that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as\\nwould make their meeting materially painful. She trusted he would never\\nspeak of Miss Thorpe; and indeed, as he must by this time be ashamed of\\nthe part he had acted, there could be no danger of it; and as long as\\nall mention of Bath scenes were avoided, she thought she could behave\\nto him very civilly. In such considerations time passed away, and it was\\ncertainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him, and\\nhave so much to say, for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival,\\nand Eleanor did not come up.\\n\\nAt that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery, and\\nlistened for its continuance; but all was silent. Scarcely, however,\\nhad she convicted her fancy of error, when the noise of something moving\\nclose to her door made her start; it seemed as if someone was touching\\nthe very doorway--and in another moment a slight motion of the lock\\nproved that some hand must be on it. She trembled a little at the idea\\nof anyone's approaching so cautiously; but resolving not to be again\\novercome by trivial appearances of alarm, or misled by a raised\\nimagination, she stepped quietly forward, and opened the door. Eleanor,\\nand only Eleanor, stood there. Catherine's spirits, however, were\\ntranquillized but for an instant, for Eleanor's cheeks were pale, and\\nher manner greatly agitated. Though evidently intending to come in, it\\nseemed an effort to enter the room, and a still greater to speak when\\nthere. Catherine, supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney's account,\\ncould only express her concern by silent attention, obliged her to be\\nseated, rubbed her temples with lavender-water, and hung over her with\\naffectionate solicitude. \"My dear Catherine, you must not--you must not\\nindeed--\" were Eleanor's first connected words. \"I am quite well.\\nThis kindness distracts me--I cannot bear it--I come to you on such an\\nerrand!\"\\n\\n\"Errand! To me!\"\\n\\n\"How shall I tell you! Oh! How shall I tell you!\"\\n\\nA new idea now darted into Catherine's mind, and turning as pale as her\\nfriend, she exclaimed, \"'Tis a messenger from Woodston!\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken, indeed,\" returned Eleanor, looking at her most\\ncompassionately; \"it is no one from Woodston. It is my father himself.\"\\nHer voice faltered, and her eyes were turned to the ground as she\\nmentioned his name. His unlooked-for return was enough in itself to make\\nCatherine's heart sink, and for a few moments she hardly supposed\\nthere were anything worse to be told. She said nothing; and Eleanor,\\nendeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness, but with eyes\\nstill cast down, soon went on. \"You are too good, I am sure, to think\\nthe worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform. I am indeed a most\\nunwilling messenger. After what has so lately passed, so lately been\\nsettled between us--how joyfully, how thankfully on my side!--as to your\\ncontinuing here as I hoped for many, many weeks longer, how can I tell\\nyou that your kindness is not to be accepted--and that the happiness\\nyour company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by--But I must not\\ntrust myself with words. My dear Catherine, we are to part. My father\\nhas recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on\\nMonday. We are going to Lord Longtown's, near Hereford, for a fortnight.\\nExplanation and apology are equally impossible. I cannot attempt\\neither.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Eleanor,\" cried Catherine, suppressing her feelings as well as\\nshe could, \"do not be so distressed. A second engagement must give\\nway to a first. I am very, very sorry we are to part--so soon, and so\\nsuddenly too; but I am not offended, indeed I am not. I can finish my\\nvisit here, you know, at any time; or I hope you will come to me. Can\\nyou, when you return from this lord's, come to Fullerton?\"\\n\\n\"It will not be in my power, Catherine.\"\\n\\n\"Come when you can, then.\"\\n\\nEleanor made no answer; and Catherine's thoughts recurring to something\\nmore directly interesting, she added, thinking aloud, \"Monday--so soon\\nas Monday; and you all go. Well, I am certain of--I shall be able to\\ntake leave, however. I need not go till just before you do, you know. Do\\nnot be distressed, Eleanor, I can go on Monday very well. My father\\nand mother's having no notice of it is of very little consequence. The\\ngeneral will send a servant with me, I dare say, half the way--and then\\nI shall soon be at Salisbury, and then I am only nine miles from home.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, Catherine! Were it settled so, it would be somewhat less\\nintolerable, though in such common attentions you would have received\\nbut half what you ought. But--how can I tell you?--tomorrow morning is\\nfixed for your leaving us, and not even the hour is left to your choice;\\nthe very carriage is ordered, and will be here at seven o'clock, and no\\nservant will be offered you.\"\\n\\nCatherine sat down, breathless and speechless. \"I could hardly believe\\nmy senses, when I heard it; and no displeasure, no resentment that\\nyou can feel at this moment, however justly great, can be more than I\\nmyself--but I must not talk of what I felt. Oh! That I could suggest\\nanything in extenuation! Good God! What will your father and mother say!\\nAfter courting you from the protection of real friends to this--almost\\ndouble distance from your home, to have you driven out of the house,\\nwithout the considerations even of decent civility! Dear, dear\\nCatherine, in being the bearer of such a message, I seem guilty myself\\nof all its insult; yet, I trust you will acquit me, for you must have\\nbeen long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress\\nof it, that my real power is nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Have I offended the general?\" said Catherine in a faltering voice.\\n\\n\"Alas! For my feelings as a daughter, all that I know, all that I\\nanswer for, is that you can have given him no just cause of offence. He\\ncertainly is greatly, very greatly discomposed; I have seldom seen him\\nmore so. His temper is not happy, and something has now occurred to\\nruffle it in an uncommon degree; some disappointment, some vexation,\\nwhich just at this moment seems important, but which I can hardly\\nsuppose you to have any concern in, for how is it possible?\"\\n\\nIt was with pain that Catherine could speak at all; and it was only for\\nEleanor's sake that she attempted it. \"I am sure,\" said she, \"I am very\\nsorry if I have offended him. It was the last thing I would willingly\\nhave done. But do not be unhappy, Eleanor. An engagement, you know, must\\nbe kept. I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner, that I might\\nhave written home. But it is of very little consequence.\"\\n\\n\"I hope, I earnestly hope, that to your real safety it will be of none;\\nbut to everything else it is of the greatest consequence: to comfort,\\nappearance, propriety, to your family, to the world. Were your friends,\\nthe Allens, still in Bath, you might go to them with comparative ease;\\na few hours would take you there; but a journey of seventy miles, to be\\ntaken post by you, at your age, alone, unattended!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, the journey is nothing. Do not think about that. And if we are to\\npart, a few hours sooner or later, you know, makes no difference. I\\ncan be ready by seven. Let me be called in time.\" Eleanor saw that she\\nwished to be alone; and believing it better for each that they should\\navoid any further conversation, now left her with, \"I shall see you in\\nthe morning.\"\\n\\nCatherine's swelling heart needed relief. In Eleanor's presence\\nfriendship and pride had equally restrained her tears, but no sooner was\\nshe gone than they burst forth in torrents. Turned from the house, and\\nin such a way! Without any reason that could justify, any apology that\\ncould atone for the abruptness, the rudeness, nay, the insolence of\\nit. Henry at a distance--not able even to bid him farewell. Every hope,\\nevery expectation from him suspended, at least, and who could say how\\nlong? Who could say when they might meet again? And all this by such\\na man as General Tilney, so polite, so well bred, and heretofore\\nso particularly fond of her! It was as incomprehensible as it was\\nmortifying and grievous. From what it could arise, and where it would\\nend, were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm. The manner in\\nwhich it was done so grossly uncivil, hurrying her away without any\\nreference to her own convenience, or allowing her even the appearance\\nof choice as to the time or mode of her travelling; of two days, the\\nearliest fixed on, and of that almost the earliest hour, as if resolved\\nto have her gone before he was stirring in the morning, that he\\nmight not be obliged even to see her. What could all this mean but\\nan intentional affront? By some means or other she must have had the\\nmisfortune to offend him. Eleanor had wished to spare her from so\\npainful a notion, but Catherine could not believe it possible that any\\ninjury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person\\nnot connected, or, at least, not supposed to be connected with it.\\n\\nHeavily passed the night. Sleep, or repose that deserved the name\\nof sleep, was out of the question. That room, in which her disturbed\\nimagination had tormented her on her first arrival, was again the scene\\nof agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers. Yet how different now the\\nsource of her inquietude from what it had been then--how mournfully\\nsuperior in reality and substance! Her anxiety had foundation in\\nfact, her fears in probability; and with a mind so occupied in the\\ncontemplation of actual and natural evil, the solitude of her situation,\\nthe darkness of her chamber, the antiquity of the building, were felt\\nand considered without the smallest emotion; and though the wind was\\nhigh, and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house,\\nshe heard it all as she lay awake, hour after hour, without curiosity or\\nterror.\\n\\nSoon after six Eleanor entered her room, eager to show attention or give\\nassistance where it was possible; but very little remained to be done.\\nCatherine had not loitered; she was almost dressed, and her packing\\nalmost finished. The possibility of some conciliatory message from the\\ngeneral occurred to her as his daughter appeared. What so natural, as\\nthat anger should pass away and repentance succeed it? And she only\\nwanted to know how far, after what had passed, an apology might properly\\nbe received by her. But the knowledge would have been useless here;\\nit was not called for; neither clemency nor dignity was put to the\\ntrial--Eleanor brought no message. Very little passed between them on\\nmeeting; each found her greatest safety in silence, and few and trivial\\nwere the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs, Catherine in\\nbusy agitation completing her dress, and Eleanor with more goodwill than\\nexperience intent upon filling the trunk. When everything was done they\\nleft the room, Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend\\nto throw a parting glance on every well-known, cherished object, and\\nwent down to the breakfast-parlour, where breakfast was prepared. She\\ntried to eat, as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as\\nto make her friend comfortable; but she had no appetite, and could not\\nswallow many mouthfuls. The contrast between this and her last breakfast\\nin that room gave her fresh misery, and strengthened her distaste for\\neverything before her. It was not four and twenty hours ago since they\\nhad met there to the same repast, but in circumstances how different!\\nWith what cheerful ease, what happy, though false, security, had she\\nthen looked around her, enjoying everything present, and fearing little\\nin future, beyond Henry's going to Woodston for a day! Happy, happy\\nbreakfast! For Henry had been there; Henry had sat by her and helped\\nher. These reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address\\nfrom her companion, who sat as deep in thought as herself; and the\\nappearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall\\nthem to the present moment. Catherine's colour rose at the sight of it;\\nand the indignity with which she was treated, striking at that instant\\non her mind with peculiar force, made her for a short time sensible only\\nof resentment. Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech.\\n\\n\"You must write to me, Catherine,\" she cried; \"you must let me hear from\\nyou as soon as possible. Till I know you to be safe at home, I shall\\nnot have an hour's comfort. For one letter, at all risks, all hazards, I\\nmust entreat. Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe\\nat Fullerton, and have found your family well, and then, till I can ask\\nfor your correspondence as I ought to do, I will not expect more. Direct\\nto me at Lord Longtown's, and, I must ask it, under cover to Alice.\"\\n\\n\"No, Eleanor, if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me, I am\\nsure I had better not write. There can be no doubt of my getting home\\nsafe.\"\\n\\nEleanor only replied, \"I cannot wonder at your feelings. I will not\\nimportune you. I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at\\na distance from you.\" But this, with the look of sorrow accompanying\\nit, was enough to melt Catherine's pride in a moment, and she instantly\\nsaid, \"Oh, Eleanor, I will write to you indeed.\"\\n\\nThere was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle,\\nthough somewhat embarrassed in speaking of. It had occurred to her that\\nafter so long an absence from home, Catherine might not be provided with\\nmoney enough for the expenses of her journey, and, upon suggesting it\\nto her with most affectionate offers of accommodation, it proved to be\\nexactly the case. Catherine had never thought on the subject till that\\nmoment, but, upon examining her purse, was convinced that but for\\nthis kindness of her friend, she might have been turned from the house\\nwithout even the means of getting home; and the distress in which she\\nmust have been thereby involved filling the minds of both, scarcely\\nanother word was said by either during the time of their remaining\\ntogether. Short, however, was that time. The carriage was soon announced\\nto be ready; and Catherine, instantly rising, a long and affectionate\\nembrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu; and,\\nas they entered the hall, unable to leave the house without some mention\\nof one whose name had not yet been spoken by either, she paused a\\nmoment, and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left\\n\"her kind remembrance for her absent friend.\" But with this approach to\\nhis name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings; and, hiding\\nher face as well as she could with her handkerchief, she darted across\\nthe hall, jumped into the chaise, and in a moment was driven from the\\ndoor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 29\\n\\n\\nCatherine was too wretched to be fearful. The journey in itself had no\\nterrors for her; and she began it without either dreading its length or\\nfeeling its solitariness. Leaning back in one corner of the carriage, in\\na violent burst of tears, she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls\\nof the abbey before she raised her head; and the highest point of ground\\nwithin the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable\\nof turning her eyes towards it. Unfortunately, the road she now\\ntravelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed\\nalong in going to and from Woodston; and, for fourteen miles, every\\nbitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on\\nwhich she had first looked under impressions so different. Every mile,\\nas it brought her nearer Woodston, added to her sufferings, and when\\nwithin the distance of five, she passed the turning which led to it, and\\nthought of Henry, so near, yet so unconscious, her grief and agitation\\nwere excessive.\\n\\nThe day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest\\nof her life. It was there, it was on that day, that the general had made\\nuse of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself, had so\\nspoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his\\nactually wishing their marriage. Yes, only ten days ago had he\\nelated her by his pointed regard--had he even confused her by his too\\nsignificant reference! And now--what had she done, or what had she\\nomitted to do, to merit such a change?\\n\\nThe only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been\\nsuch as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge. Henry and her own\\nheart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly\\nentertained; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each.\\nDesignedly, at least, Henry could not have betrayed her. If, indeed, by\\nany strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of\\nwhat she had dared to think and look for, of her causeless fancies\\nand injurious examinations, she could not wonder at any degree of his\\nindignation. If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer, she could\\nnot wonder at his even turning her from his house. But a justification\\nso full of torture to herself, she trusted, would not be in his power.\\n\\nAnxious as were all her conjectures on this point, it was not, however,\\nthe one on which she dwelt most. There was a thought yet nearer, a more\\nprevailing, more impetuous concern. How Henry would think, and feel,\\nand look, when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of\\nher being gone, was a question of force and interest to rise over every\\nother, to be never ceasing, alternately irritating and soothing; it\\nsometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence, and at others\\nwas answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment. To\\nthe general, of course, he would not dare to speak; but to Eleanor--what\\nmight he not say to Eleanor about her?\\n\\nIn this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries, on any one article\\nof which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose, the hours\\npassed away, and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for.\\nThe pressing anxieties of thought, which prevented her from noticing\\nanything before her, when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston,\\nsaved her at the same time from watching her progress; and though no\\nobject on the road could engage a moment's attention, she found no stage\\nof it tedious. From this, she was preserved too by another cause, by\\nfeeling no eagerness for her journey's conclusion; for to return in such\\na manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting\\nwith those she loved best, even after an absence such as hers--an eleven\\nweeks' absence. What had she to say that would not humble herself and\\npain her family, that would not increase her own grief by the confession\\nof it, extend an useless resentment, and perhaps involve the innocent\\nwith the guilty in undistinguishing ill will? She could never do justice\\nto Henry and Eleanor's merit; she felt it too strongly for expression;\\nand should a dislike be taken against them, should they be thought of\\nunfavourably, on their father's account, it would cut her to the heart.\\n\\nWith these feelings, she rather dreaded than sought for the first view\\nof that well-known spire which would announce her within twenty miles of\\nhome. Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger; but\\nafter the first stage she had been indebted to the post-masters for the\\nnames of the places which were then to conduct her to it; so great\\nhad been her ignorance of her route. She met with nothing, however,\\nto distress or frighten her. Her youth, civil manners, and liberal\\npay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could\\nrequire; and stopping only to change horses, she travelled on for\\nabout eleven hours without accident or alarm, and between six and seven\\no'clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton.\\n\\nA heroine returning, at the close of her career, to her native village,\\nin all the triumph of recovered reputation, and all the dignity of\\na countess, with a long train of noble relations in their several\\nphaetons, and three waiting-maids in a travelling chaise and four,\\nbehind her, is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well\\ndelight to dwell; it gives credit to every conclusion, and the author\\nmust share in the glory she so liberally bestows. But my affair is\\nwidely different; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude and\\ndisgrace; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness.\\nA heroine in a hack post-chaise is such a blow upon sentiment, as no\\nattempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand. Swiftly therefore shall her\\npost-boy drive through the village, amid the gaze of Sunday groups, and\\nspeedy shall be her descent from it.\\n\\nBut, whatever might be the distress of Catherine's mind, as she thus\\nadvanced towards the parsonage, and whatever the humiliation of her\\nbiographer in relating it, she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday\\nnature for those to whom she went; first, in the appearance of her\\ncarriage--and secondly, in herself. The chaise of a traveller being\\na rare sight in Fullerton, the whole family were immediately at the\\nwindow; and to have it stop at the sweep-gate was a pleasure to brighten\\nevery eye and occupy every fancy--a pleasure quite unlooked for by all\\nbut the two youngest children, a boy and girl of six and four years old,\\nwho expected a brother or sister in every carriage. Happy the glance\\nthat first distinguished Catherine! Happy the voice that proclaimed the\\ndiscovery! But whether such happiness were the lawful property of George\\nor Harriet could never be exactly understood.\\n\\nHer father, mother, Sarah, George, and Harriet, all assembled at the\\ndoor to welcome her with affectionate eagerness, was a sight to awaken\\nthe best feelings of Catherine's heart; and in the embrace of each, as\\nshe stepped from the carriage, she found herself soothed beyond anything\\nthat she had believed possible. So surrounded, so caressed, she was even\\nhappy! In the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was\\nsubdued, and the pleasure of seeing her, leaving them at first little\\nleisure for calm curiosity, they were all seated round the tea-table,\\nwhich Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller,\\nwhose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice, before any inquiry so\\ndirect as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her.\\n\\nReluctantly, and with much hesitation, did she then begin what might\\nperhaps, at the end of half an hour, be termed, by the courtesy of her\\nhearers, an explanation; but scarcely, within that time, could they\\nat all discover the cause, or collect the particulars, of her sudden\\nreturn. They were far from being an irritable race; far from any\\nquickness in catching, or bitterness in resenting, affronts: but here,\\nwhen the whole was unfolded, was an insult not to be overlooked, nor,\\nfor the first half hour, to be easily pardoned. Without suffering any\\nromantic alarm, in the consideration of their daughter's long and lonely\\njourney, Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been\\nproductive of much unpleasantness to her; that it was what they could\\nnever have voluntarily suffered; and that, in forcing her on such\\na measure, General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor\\nfeelingly--neither as a gentleman nor as a parent. Why he had done it,\\nwhat could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality, and so\\nsuddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual\\nill will, was a matter which they were at least as far from divining\\nas Catherine herself; but it did not oppress them by any means so long;\\nand, after a due course of useless conjecture, that \"it was a strange\\nbusiness, and that he must be a very strange man,\" grew enough for all\\ntheir indignation and wonder; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the\\nsweets of incomprehensibility, exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful\\nardour. \"My dear, you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble,\"\\nsaid her mother at last; \"depend upon it, it is something not at all\\nworth understanding.\"\\n\\n\"I can allow for his wishing Catherine away, when he recollected this\\nengagement,\" said Sarah, \"but why not do it civilly?\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry for the young people,\" returned Mrs. Morland; \"they must\\nhave a sad time of it; but as for anything else, it is no matter now;\\nCatherine is safe at home, and our comfort does not depend upon General\\nTilney.\" Catherine sighed. \"Well,\" continued her philosophic mother, \"I\\nam glad I did not know of your journey at the time; but now it is all\\nover, perhaps there is no great harm done. It is always good for\\nyoung people to be put upon exerting themselves; and you know, my dear\\nCatherine, you always were a sad little scatter-brained creature; but\\nnow you must have been forced to have your wits about you, with so much\\nchanging of chaises and so forth; and I hope it will appear that you\\nhave not left anything behind you in any of the pockets.\"\\n\\nCatherine hoped so too, and tried to feel an interest in her own\\namendment, but her spirits were quite worn down; and, to be silent and\\nalone becoming soon her only wish, she readily agreed to her mother's\\nnext counsel of going early to bed. Her parents, seeing nothing in\\nher ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified\\nfeelings, and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey,\\nparted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away; and\\nthough, when they all met the next morning, her recovery was not equal\\nto their hopes, they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being\\nany deeper evil. They never once thought of her heart, which, for the\\nparents of a young lady of seventeen, just returned from her first\\nexcursion from home, was odd enough!\\n\\nAs soon as breakfast was over, she sat down to fulfil her promise to\\nMiss Tilney, whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her\\nfriend's disposition was already justified, for already did Catherine\\nreproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly, with\\nhaving never enough valued her merits or kindness, and never enough\\ncommiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure. The\\nstrength of these feelings, however, was far from assisting her pen;\\nand never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing Eleanor\\nTilney. To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her\\nsentiments and her situation, convey gratitude without servile regret,\\nbe guarded without coldness, and honest without resentment--a letter\\nwhich Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of--and, above all,\\nwhich she might not blush herself, if Henry should chance to see, was an\\nundertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance; and, after\\nlong thought and much perplexity, to be very brief was all that she\\ncould determine on with any confidence of safety. The money therefore\\nwhich Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful\\nthanks, and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart.\\n\\n\"This has been a strange acquaintance,\" observed Mrs. Morland, as the\\nletter was finished; \"soon made and soon ended. I am sorry it happens\\nso, for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people; and\\nyou were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella. Ah! Poor James! Well,\\nwe must live and learn; and the next new friends you make I hope will be\\nbetter worth keeping.\"\\n\\nCatherine coloured as she warmly answered, \"No friend can be better\\nworth keeping than Eleanor.\"\\n\\n\"If so, my dear, I dare say you will meet again some time or other; do\\nnot be uneasy. It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the\\ncourse of a few years; and then what a pleasure it will be!\"\\n\\nMrs. Morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation. The hope\\nof meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into\\nCatherine's head what might happen within that time to make a meeting\\ndreadful to her. She could never forget Henry Tilney, or think of him\\nwith less tenderness than she did at that moment; but he might forget\\nher; and in that case, to meet--! Her eyes filled with tears as she\\npictured her acquaintance so renewed; and her mother, perceiving her\\ncomfortable suggestions to have had no good effect, proposed, as another\\nexpedient for restoring her spirits, that they should call on Mrs.\\nAllen.\\n\\nThe two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart; and, as they walked,\\nMrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of\\nJames's disappointment. \"We are sorry for him,\" said she; \"but otherwise\\nthere is no harm done in the match going off; for it could not be\\na desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the\\nsmallest acquaintance with, and who was so entirely without fortune; and\\nnow, after such behaviour, we cannot think at all well of her. Just at\\npresent it comes hard to poor James; but that will not last forever; and\\nI dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life, for the foolishness\\nof his first choice.\"\\n\\nThis was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could\\nlisten to; another sentence might have endangered her complaisance,\\nand made her reply less rational; for soon were all her thinking powers\\nswallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits\\nsince last she had trodden that well-known road. It was not three months\\nago since, wild with joyful expectation, she had there run backwards\\nand forwards some ten times a day, with an heart light, gay, and\\nindependent; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed, and\\nfree from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it. Three\\nmonths ago had seen her all this; and now, how altered a being did she\\nreturn!\\n\\nShe was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her\\nunlooked-for appearance, acting on a steady affection, would naturally\\ncall forth; and great was their surprise, and warm their displeasure,\\non hearing how she had been treated--though Mrs. Morland's account of\\nit was no inflated representation, no studied appeal to their passions.\\n\"Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening,\" said she. \"She\\ntravelled all the way post by herself, and knew nothing of coming till\\nSaturday night; for General Tilney, from some odd fancy or other, all\\nof a sudden grew tired of having her there, and almost turned her out\\nof the house. Very unfriendly, certainly; and he must be a very odd\\nman; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again! And it is a great\\ncomfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature, but can shift\\nvery well for herself.\"\\n\\nMr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable\\nresentment of a sensible friend; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions\\nquite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself. His\\nwonder, his conjectures, and his explanations became in succession hers,\\nwith the addition of this single remark--\"I really have not patience\\nwith the general\"--to fill up every accidental pause. And, \"I really\\nhave not patience with the general,\" was uttered twice after Mr.\\nAllen left the room, without any relaxation of anger, or any material\\ndigression of thought. A more considerable degree of wandering attended\\nthe third repetition; and, after completing the fourth, she immediately\\nadded, \"Only think, my dear, of my having got that frightful great rent\\nin my best Mechlin so charmingly mended, before I left Bath, that one\\ncan hardly see where it was. I must show it you some day or other. Bath\\nis a nice place, Catherine, after all. I assure you I did not above half\\nlike coming away. Mrs. Thorpe's being there was such a comfort to us,\\nwas not it? You know, you and I were quite forlorn at first.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but that did not last long,\" said Catherine, her eyes brightening\\nat the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence\\nthere.\\n\\n\"Very true: we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe, and then we wanted for\\nnothing. My dear, do not you think these silk gloves wear very well?\\nI put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms, you\\nknow, and I have worn them a great deal since. Do you remember that\\nevening?\"\\n\\n\"Do I! Oh! Perfectly.\"\\n\\n\"It was very agreeable, was not it? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us, and I\\nalways thought him a great addition, he is so very agreeable. I have a\\nnotion you danced with him, but am not quite sure. I remember I had my\\nfavourite gown on.\"\\n\\nCatherine could not answer; and, after a short trial of other subjects,\\nMrs. Allen again returned to--\"I really have not patience with the\\ngeneral! Such an agreeable, worthy man as he seemed to be! I do not\\nsuppose, Mrs. Morland, you ever saw a better-bred man in your life. His\\nlodgings were taken the very day after he left them, Catherine. But no\\nwonder; Milsom Street, you know.\"\\n\\nAs they walked home again, Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her\\ndaughter's mind the happiness of having such steady well-wishers as Mr.\\nand Mrs. Allen, and the very little consideration which the neglect or\\nunkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with\\nher, while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of her\\nearliest friends. There was a great deal of good sense in all this; but\\nthere are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has\\nvery little power; and Catherine's feelings contradicted almost every\\nposition her mother advanced. It was upon the behaviour of these very\\nslight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended; and\\nwhile Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the\\njustness of her own representations, Catherine was silently reflecting\\nthat now Henry must have arrived at Northanger; now he must have heard\\nof her departure; and now, perhaps, they were all setting off for\\nHereford.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 30\\n\\n\\nCatherine's disposition was not naturally sedentary, nor had her habits\\nbeen ever very industrious; but whatever might hitherto have been her\\ndefects of that sort, her mother could not but perceive them now to be\\ngreatly increased. She could neither sit still nor employ herself for\\nten minutes together, walking round the garden and orchard again and\\nagain, as if nothing but motion was voluntary; and it seemed as if she\\ncould even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time\\nin the parlour. Her loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration. In her\\nrambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature of herself; but\\nin her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all that she had\\nbeen before.\\n\\nFor two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint;\\nbut when a third night's rest had neither restored her cheerfulness,\\nimproved her in useful activity, nor given her a greater inclination for\\nneedlework, she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of, \"My\\ndear Catherine, I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady. I do not\\nknow when poor Richard's cravats would be done, if he had no friend\\nbut you. Your head runs too much upon Bath; but there is a time for\\neverything--a time for balls and plays, and a time for work. You have\\nhad a long run of amusement, and now you must try to be useful.\"\\n\\nCatherine took up her work directly, saying, in a dejected voice, that\\n\"her head did not run upon Bath--much.\"\\n\\n\"Then you are fretting about General Tilney, and that is very simple\\nof you; for ten to one whether you ever see him again. You should never\\nfret about trifles.\" After a short silence--\"I hope, my Catherine, you\\nare not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand\\nas Northanger. That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed.\\nWherever you are you should always be contented, but especially at home,\\nbecause there you must spend the most of your time. I did not quite\\nlike, at breakfast, to hear you talk so much about the French bread at\\nNorthanger.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I do not care about the bread. It is all the same to me what\\nI eat.\"\\n\\n\"There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much\\nsuch a subject, about young girls that have been spoilt for home by\\ngreat acquaintance--The Mirror, I think. I will look it out for you some\\nday or other, because I am sure it will do you good.\"\\n\\nCatherine said no more, and, with an endeavour to do right, applied\\nto her work; but, after a few minutes, sunk again, without knowing it\\nherself, into languor and listlessness, moving herself in her chair,\\nfrom the irritation of weariness, much oftener than she moved her\\nneedle. Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse; and seeing,\\nin her daughter's absent and dissatisfied look, the full proof of that\\nrepining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want of\\ncheerfulness, hastily left the room to fetch the book in question,\\nanxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady. It was some\\ntime before she could find what she looked for; and other family matters\\noccurring to detain her, a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere she\\nreturned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped. Her\\navocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself,\\nshe knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes,\\ntill, on entering the room, the first object she beheld was a young\\nman whom she had never seen before. With a look of much respect, he\\nimmediately rose, and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter\\nas \"Mr. Henry Tilney,\" with the embarrassment of real sensibility began\\nto apologize for his appearance there, acknowledging that after what had\\npassed he had little right to expect a welcome at Fullerton, and stating\\nhis impatience to be assured of Miss Morland's having reached her home\\nin safety, as the cause of his intrusion. He did not address himself to\\nan uncandid judge or a resentful heart. Far from comprehending him or\\nhis sister in their father's misconduct, Mrs. Morland had been always\\nkindly disposed towards each, and instantly, pleased by his appearance,\\nreceived him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence;\\nthanking him for such an attention to her daughter, assuring him that\\nthe friends of her children were always welcome there, and entreating\\nhim to say not another word of the past.\\n\\nHe was not ill-inclined to obey this request, for, though his heart was\\ngreatly relieved by such unlooked-for mildness, it was not just at that\\nmoment in his power to say anything to the purpose. Returning in silence\\nto his seat, therefore, he remained for some minutes most civilly\\nanswering all Mrs. Morland's common remarks about the weather and\\nroads. Catherine meanwhile--the anxious, agitated, happy, feverish\\nCatherine--said not a word; but her glowing cheek and brightened eye\\nmade her mother trust that this good-natured visit would at least set\\nher heart at ease for a time, and gladly therefore did she lay aside the\\nfirst volume of The Mirror for a future hour.\\n\\nDesirous of Mr. Morland's assistance, as well in giving encouragement,\\nas in finding conversation for her guest, whose embarrassment on his\\nfather's account she earnestly pitied, Mrs. Morland had very early\\ndispatched one of the children to summon him; but Mr. Morland was from\\nhome--and being thus without any support, at the end of a quarter of\\nan hour she had nothing to say. After a couple of minutes' unbroken\\nsilence, Henry, turning to Catherine for the first time since her\\nmother's entrance, asked her, with sudden alacrity, if Mr. and Mrs.\\nAllen were now at Fullerton? And on developing, from amidst all her\\nperplexity of words in reply, the meaning, which one short syllable\\nwould have given, immediately expressed his intention of paying his\\nrespects to them, and, with a rising colour, asked her if she would\\nhave the goodness to show him the way. \"You may see the house from this\\nwindow, sir,\" was information on Sarah's side, which produced only a\\nbow of acknowledgment from the gentleman, and a silencing nod from\\nher mother; for Mrs. Morland, thinking it probable, as a secondary\\nconsideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours, that he\\nmight have some explanation to give of his father's behaviour, which it\\nmust be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine, would\\nnot on any account prevent her accompanying him. They began their walk,\\nand Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it.\\nSome explanation on his father's account he had to give; but his first\\npurpose was to explain himself, and before they reached Mr. Allen's\\ngrounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think it could\\never be repeated too often. She was assured of his affection; and that\\nheart in return was solicited, which, perhaps, they pretty equally\\nknew was already entirely his own; for, though Henry was now sincerely\\nattached to her, though he felt and delighted in all the excellencies\\nof her character and truly loved her society, I must confess that his\\naffection originated in nothing better than gratitude, or, in other\\nwords, that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only\\ncause of giving her a serious thought. It is a new circumstance in\\nromance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine's\\ndignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a wild\\nimagination will at least be all my own.\\n\\nA very short visit to Mrs. Allen, in which Henry talked at random,\\nwithout sense or connection, and Catherine, rapt in the contemplation of\\nher own unutterable happiness, scarcely opened her lips, dismissed them\\nto the ecstasies of another tete-a-tete; and before it was suffered to\\nclose, she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental\\nauthority in his present application. On his return from Woodston, two\\ndays before, he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father,\\nhastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland's departure, and ordered\\nto think of her no more.\\n\\nSuch was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand.\\nThe affrighted Catherine, amidst all the terrors of expectation, as she\\nlistened to this account, could not but rejoice in the kind caution\\nwith which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious\\nrejection, by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject; and\\nas he proceeded to give the particulars, and explain the motives of\\nhis father's conduct, her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant\\ndelight. The general had had nothing to accuse her of, nothing to lay\\nto her charge, but her being the involuntary, unconscious object of a\\ndeception which his pride could not pardon, and which a better pride\\nwould have been ashamed to own. She was guilty only of being less rich\\nthan he had supposed her to be. Under a mistaken persuasion of her\\npossessions and claims, he had courted her acquaintance in Bath,\\nsolicited her company at Northanger, and designed her for his\\ndaughter-in-law. On discovering his error, to turn her from the house\\nseemed the best, though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his\\nresentment towards herself, and his contempt of her family.\\n\\nJohn Thorpe had first misled him. The general, perceiving his son\\none night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss\\nMorland, had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of her\\nthan her name. Thorpe, most happy to be on speaking terms with a man\\nof General Tilney's importance, had been joyfully and proudly\\ncommunicative; and being at that time not only in daily expectation\\nof Morland's engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well resolved upon\\nmarrying Catherine himself, his vanity induced him to represent the\\nfamily as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him\\nbelieve them. With whomsoever he was, or was likely to be connected, his\\nown consequence always required that theirs should be great, and as his\\nintimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew their fortune.\\nThe expectations of his friend Morland, therefore, from the first\\noverrated, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually\\nincreasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the\\nmoment, by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland's\\npreferment, trebling his private fortune, bestowing a rich aunt, and\\nsinking half the children, he was able to represent the whole family\\nto the general in a most respectable light. For Catherine, however, the\\npeculiar object of the general's curiosity, and his own speculations,\\nhe had yet something more in reserve, and the ten or fifteen thousand\\npounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr.\\nAllen's estate. Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on\\nher being handsomely legacied hereafter; and to speak of her therefore\\nas the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally\\nfollowed. Upon such intelligence the general had proceeded; for never\\nhad it occurred to him to doubt its authority. Thorpe's interest in the\\nfamily, by his sister's approaching connection with one of its members,\\nand his own views on another (circumstances of which he boasted with\\nalmost equal openness), seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth; and\\nto these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and\\nchildless, of Miss Morland's being under their care, and--as soon as his\\nacquaintance allowed him to judge--of their treating her with parental\\nkindness. His resolution was soon formed. Already had he discerned a\\nliking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son; and thankful\\nfor Mr. Thorpe's communication, he almost instantly determined to spare\\nno pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest\\nhopes. Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all\\nthis, than his own children. Henry and Eleanor, perceiving nothing in\\nher situation likely to engage their father's particular respect, had\\nseen with astonishment the suddenness, continuance, and extent of his\\nattention; and though latterly, from some hints which had accompanied an\\nalmost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to\\nattach her, Henry was convinced of his father's believing it to be\\nan advantageous connection, it was not till the late explanation at\\nNorthanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations\\nwhich had hurried him on. That they were false, the general had learnt\\nfrom the very person who had suggested them, from Thorpe himself, whom\\nhe had chanced to meet again in town, and who, under the influence of\\nexactly opposite feelings, irritated by Catherine's refusal, and\\nyet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a\\nreconciliation between Morland and Isabella, convinced that they were\\nseparated forever, and spurning a friendship which could be no longer\\nserviceable, hastened to contradict all that he had said before to\\nthe advantage of the Morlands--confessed himself to have been totally\\nmistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character, misled by\\nthe rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance\\nand credit, whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks\\nproved him to be neither; for after coming eagerly forward on the first\\noverture of a marriage between the families, with the most liberal\\nproposals, he had, on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of\\nthe relator, been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of\\ngiving the young people even a decent support. They were, in fact, a\\nnecessitous family; numerous, too, almost beyond example; by no means\\nrespected in their own neighbourhood, as he had lately had particular\\nopportunities of discovering; aiming at a style of life which their\\nfortune could not warrant; seeking to better themselves by wealthy\\nconnections; a forward, bragging, scheming race.\\n\\nThe terrified general pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring\\nlook; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error. The Allens, he believed,\\nhad lived near them too long, and he knew the young man on whom the\\nFullerton estate must devolve. The general needed no more. Enraged with\\nalmost everybody in the world but himself, he set out the next day for\\nthe abbey, where his performances have been seen.\\n\\nI leave it to my reader's sagacity to determine how much of all this\\nit was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine, how\\nmuch of it he could have learnt from his father, in what points his own\\nconjectures might assist him, and what portion must yet remain to be\\ntold in a letter from James. I have united for their ease what they must\\ndivide for mine. Catherine, at any rate, heard enough to feel that in\\nsuspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife,\\nshe had scarcely sinned against his character, or magnified his cruelty.\\n\\nHenry, in having such things to relate of his father, was almost\\nas pitiable as in their first avowal to himself. He blushed for the\\nnarrow-minded counsel which he was obliged to expose. The conversation\\nbetween them at Northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind. Henry's\\nindignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated, on comprehending\\nhis father's views, and being ordered to acquiesce in them, had been\\nopen and bold. The general, accustomed on every ordinary occasion to\\ngive the law in his family, prepared for no reluctance but of feeling,\\nno opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words, could ill\\nbrook the opposition of his son, steady as the sanction of reason and\\nthe dictate of conscience could make it. But, in such a cause, his\\nanger, though it must shock, could not intimidate Henry, who was\\nsustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice. He felt himself\\nbound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland, and believing\\nthat heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain, no unworthy\\nretraction of a tacit consent, no reversing decree of unjustifiable\\nanger, could shake his fidelity, or influence the resolutions it\\nprompted.\\n\\nHe steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire, an\\nengagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of\\nCatherine, and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his\\nhand. The general was furious in his anger, and they parted in dreadful\\ndisagreement. Henry, in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours\\nwere required to compose, had returned almost instantly to Woodston,\\nand, on the afternoon of the following day, had begun his journey to\\nFullerton.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 31\\n\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Morland's surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for\\ntheir consent to his marrying their daughter was, for a few minutes,\\nconsiderable, it having never entered their heads to suspect an\\nattachment on either side; but as nothing, after all, could be more\\nnatural than Catherine's being beloved, they soon learnt to consider it\\nwith only the happy agitation of gratified pride, and, as far as they\\nalone were concerned, had not a single objection to start. His pleasing\\nmanners and good sense were self-evident recommendations; and having\\nnever heard evil of him, it was not their way to suppose any evil could\\nbe told. Goodwill supplying the place of experience, his character\\nneeded no attestation. \"Catherine would make a sad, heedless young\\nhousekeeper to be sure,\" was her mother's foreboding remark; but quick\\nwas the consolation of there being nothing like practice.\\n\\nThere was but one obstacle, in short, to be mentioned; but till that one\\nwas removed, it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement.\\nTheir tempers were mild, but their principles were steady, and while\\nhis parent so expressly forbade the connection, they could not allow\\nthemselves to encourage it. That the general should come forward to\\nsolicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily approve it,\\nthey were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation; but\\nthe decent appearance of consent must be yielded, and that once\\nobtained--and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be\\nvery long denied--their willing approbation was instantly to follow. His\\nconsent was all that they wished for. They were no more inclined than\\nentitled to demand his money. Of a very considerable fortune, his son\\nwas, by marriage settlements, eventually secure; his present income was\\nan income of independence and comfort, and under every pecuniary view,\\nit was a match beyond the claims of their daughter.\\n\\nThe young people could not be surprised at a decision like this. They\\nfelt and they deplored--but they could not resent it; and they parted,\\nendeavouring to hope that such a change in the general, as each believed\\nalmost impossible, might speedily take place, to unite them again in\\nthe fullness of privileged affection. Henry returned to what was now\\nhis only home, to watch over his young plantations, and extend his\\nimprovements for her sake, to whose share in them he looked anxiously\\nforward; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry. Whether the\\ntorments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence, let\\nus not inquire. Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did--they had been too kind\\nto exact any promise; and whenever Catherine received a letter, as, at\\nthat time, happened pretty often, they always looked another way.\\n\\nThe anxiety, which in this state of their attachment must be the portion\\nof Henry and Catherine, and of all who loved either, as to its final\\nevent, can hardly extend, I fear, to the bosom of my readers, who will\\nsee in the tell-tale compression of the pages before them, that we are\\nall hastening together to perfect felicity. The means by which their\\nearly marriage was effected can be the only doubt: what probable\\ncircumstance could work upon a temper like the general's? The\\ncircumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with\\na man of fortune and consequence, which took place in the course of\\nthe summer--an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good\\nhumour, from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained\\nhis forgiveness of Henry, and his permission for him \"to be a fool if he\\nliked it!\"\\n\\nThe marriage of Eleanor Tilney, her removal from all the evils of such\\na home as Northanger had been made by Henry's banishment, to the home of\\nher choice and the man of her choice, is an event which I expect to\\ngive general satisfaction among all her acquaintance. My own joy on the\\noccasion is very sincere. I know no one more entitled, by unpretending\\nmerit, or better prepared by habitual suffering, to receive and enjoy\\nfelicity. Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin;\\nand he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from\\naddressing her. His unexpected accession to title and fortune had\\nremoved all his difficulties; and never had the general loved his\\ndaughter so well in all her hours of companionship, utility, and patient\\nendurance as when he first hailed her \"Your Ladyship!\" Her husband was\\nreally deserving of her; independent of his peerage, his wealth, and\\nhis attachment, being to a precision the most charming young man in the\\nworld. Any further definition of his merits must be unnecessary; the\\nmost charming young man in the world is instantly before the imagination\\nof us all. Concerning the one in question, therefore, I have only to\\nadd--aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a\\ncharacter not connected with my fable--that this was the very\\ngentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of\\nwashing-bills, resulting from a long visit at Northanger, by which my\\nheroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures.\\n\\nThe influence of the viscount and viscountess in their brother's behalf\\nwas assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland's circumstances\\nwhich, as soon as the general would allow himself to be informed, they\\nwere qualified to give. It taught him that he had been scarcely\\nmore misled by Thorpe's first boast of the family wealth than by his\\nsubsequent malicious overthrow of it; that in no sense of the word were\\nthey necessitous or poor, and that Catherine would have three thousand\\npounds. This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that\\nit greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride; and by no\\nmeans without its effect was the private intelligence, which he was at\\nsome pains to procure, that the Fullerton estate, being entirely at\\nthe disposal of its present proprietor, was consequently open to every\\ngreedy speculation.\\n\\nOn the strength of this, the general, soon after Eleanor's marriage,\\npermitted his son to return to Northanger, and thence made him the\\nbearer of his consent, very courteously worded in a page full of empty\\nprofessions to Mr. Morland. The event which it authorized soon followed:\\nHenry and Catherine were married, the bells rang, and everybody smiled;\\nand, as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their\\nmeeting, it will not appear, after all the dreadful delays occasioned by\\nthe general's cruelty, that they were essentially hurt by it. To begin\\nperfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen is\\nto do pretty well; and professing myself moreover convinced that the\\ngeneral's unjust interference, so far from being really injurious to\\ntheir felicity, was perhaps rather conducive to it, by improving their\\nknowledge of each other, and adding strength to their attachment,\\nI leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may concern, whether the\\ntendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny, or\\nreward filial disobedience.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Vide a letter from Mr. Richardson, No. 97, Vol. II, Rambler.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA NOTE ON THE TEXT\\n\\nNorthanger Abbey was written in 1797-98 under a different title.

This\\nwas the page at which the favourite volume always opened:\\n\\n           \"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.\\n\\n\"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,\\ndaughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of\\nGloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, born\\nJune 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5,\\n1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.\"\\n\\nPrecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's\\nhands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of\\nhimself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth--\\n\"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove,\\nEsq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,\" and by inserting most\\naccurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife.\\n\\nThen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable\\nfamily, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;\\nhow mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,\\nrepresenting a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of\\nloyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with\\nall the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two\\nhandsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and\\nmotto:--\"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,\" and\\nSir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:--\\n\\n\"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the\\nsecond Sir Walter.\"\\n\\nVanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;\\nvanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome in\\nhis youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.  Few women\\ncould think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could\\nthe valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held\\nin society.  He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to\\nthe blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united\\nthese gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and\\ndevotion.\\n\\nHis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since\\nto them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any\\nthing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,\\nsensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never\\nrequired indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, or\\nconcealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for\\nseventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world\\nherself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children,\\nto attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her\\nwhen she was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldest\\nsixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an\\nawful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a\\nconceited, silly father.  She had, however, one very intimate friend, a\\nsensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment\\nto herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on\\nher kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help\\nand maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had\\nbeen anxiously giving her daughters.\\n\\nThis friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been\\nanticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years had\\npassed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still near\\nneighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other\\na widow.\\n\\nThat Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well\\nprovided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no\\napology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably\\ndiscontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but\\nSir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.  Be it\\nknown then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one\\nor two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.  For\\none daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had\\nsucceeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother's rights\\nand consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her\\ninfluence had always been great, and they had gone on together most\\nhappily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.  Mary had\\nacquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles\\nMusgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of\\ncharacter, which must have placed her high with any people of real\\nunderstanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no\\nweight, her convenience was always to give way--she was only Anne.\\n\\nTo Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued\\ngod-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all; but\\nit was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.\\n\\nA few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her\\nbloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had\\nfound little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate\\nfeatures and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in\\nthem, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem. He had\\nnever indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in\\nany other page of his favourite work.  All equality of alliance must\\nrest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old\\ncountry family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore\\ngiven all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or\\nother, marry suitably.\\n\\nIt sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she\\nwas ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been\\nneither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely\\nany charm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome\\nMiss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter\\nmight be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be\\ndeemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming\\nas ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he\\ncould plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance\\nwere growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the\\nneighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about\\nLady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.\\n\\nElizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.\\nThirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and\\ndirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never have\\ngiven the idea of her being younger than she was.  For thirteen years\\nhad she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at\\nhome, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking\\nimmediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and\\ndining-rooms in the country.  Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had\\nseen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood\\nafforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled\\nup to London with her father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the\\ngreat world.  She had the remembrance of all this, she had the\\nconsciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and\\nsome apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as\\nhandsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and\\nwould have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by\\nbaronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again\\ntake up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\\nbut now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of her\\nown birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\\nmade the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\\nopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and\\npushed it away.\\n\\nShe had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially\\nthe history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of.\\nThe heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose\\nrights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed\\nher.\\n\\nShe had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\\nin the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to\\nmarry him, and her father had always meant that she should.  He had not\\nbeen known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir\\nWalter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not\\nbeen met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making\\nallowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their\\nspring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr\\nElliot had been forced into the introduction.\\n\\nHe was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the\\nlaw; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his\\nfavour was confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked\\nof and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.  The\\nfollowing spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\\nagain encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and\\nthe next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing his\\nfortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he\\nhad purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of\\ninferior birth.\\n\\nSir Walter had resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that he\\nought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so\\npublicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\" he\\nobserved, \"once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of\\nCommons.\"  His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little\\nregarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as\\nunsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter\\nconsidered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between them had\\nceased.\\n\\nThis very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of\\nseveral years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for\\nhimself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose strong\\nfamily pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter\\nElliot's eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her\\nfeelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.  Yet so\\nmiserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present\\ntime (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could\\nnot admit him to be worth thinking of again.  The disgrace of his first\\nmarriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it\\nperpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse;\\nbut he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they\\nhad been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most\\nslightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and\\nthe honours which were hereafter to be his own.  This could not be\\npardoned.\\n\\nSuch were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares\\nto alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the\\nprosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings\\nto give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle,\\nto fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no\\ntalents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\\n\\nBut now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\nadded to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.  She\\nknew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the\\nheavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr\\nShepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was\\ngood, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required\\nin its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,\\nmoderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but\\nwith her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he\\nhad been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible for him to\\nspend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was\\nimperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only\\ngrowing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it\\nbecame vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his\\ndaughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town;\\nhe had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?  Does it occur to\\nyou that there is any one article in which we can retrench?\" and\\nElizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm,\\nset seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed\\nthese two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities,\\nand to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which\\nexpedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no\\npresent down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these\\nmeasures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real\\nextent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged\\nto confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose of\\ndeeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her\\nfather; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of\\nlessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or\\nrelinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\\n\\nThere was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose\\nof; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no\\ndifference.  He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the\\npower, but he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never\\ndisgrace his name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted\\nwhole and entire, as he had received it.\\n\\nTheir two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the\\nneighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and\\nreduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence\\nof taste or pride.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\n\\nMr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold\\nor his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted\\nby anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and\\nonly begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent\\njudgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully\\nexpected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see\\nfinally adopted.\\n\\nLady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it\\nmuch serious consideration.  She was a woman rather of sound than of\\nquick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this\\ninstance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.\\nShe was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;\\nbut she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous\\nfor the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what was\\ndue to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.  She was a\\nbenevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments,\\nmost correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with\\nmanners that were held a standard of good-breeding.  She had a\\ncultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent;\\nbut she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value for\\nrank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of those\\nwho possessed them.  Herself the widow of only a knight, she gave the\\ndignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his\\nclaims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging\\nlandlord, the husband of her very dear friend, the father of Anne and\\nher sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to\\na great deal of compassion and consideration under his present\\ndifficulties.\\n\\nThey must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was very\\nanxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and\\nElizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne, who\\nnever seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the\\nquestion. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in\\nmarking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to\\nSir Walter. Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of honesty\\nagainst importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete\\nreformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of\\nindifference for everything but justice and equity.\\n\\n\"If we can persuade your father to all this,\" said Lady Russell,\\nlooking over her paper, \"much may be done.  If he will adopt these\\nregulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we may be able\\nto convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability\\nin itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the\\ntrue dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the\\neyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.  What will\\nhe be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have\\ndone, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case; and\\nit is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as\\nit always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.  We\\nmust be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has\\ncontracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the\\nfeelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man.\"\\n\\nThis was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be\\nproceeding, his friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all\\nthe expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure,\\nand saw no dignity in anything short of it.  She wanted it to be\\nprescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated Lady Russell's influence\\nhighly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own\\nconscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficulty\\nin persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.  Her\\nknowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the\\nsacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of\\nboth, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle\\nreductions.\\n\\nHow Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little\\nconsequence.  Lady Russell's had no success at all: could not be put up\\nwith, were not to be borne. \"What! every comfort of life knocked off!\\nJourneys, London, servants, horses, table--contractions and\\nrestrictions every where!  To live no longer with the decencies even of\\na private gentleman!  No, he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once,\\nthan remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"\\n\\n\"Quit Kellynch Hall.\"  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr\\nShepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's\\nretrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done\\nwithout a change of abode.  \"Since the idea had been started in the\\nvery quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in\\nconfessing his judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not\\nappear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of\\nliving in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient\\ndignity to support.  In any other place Sir Walter might judge for\\nhimself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in\\nwhatever way he might choose to model his household.\"\\n\\nSir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of\\ndoubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go was\\nsettled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\\n\\nThere had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in\\nthe country.  All Anne's wishes had been for the latter.  A small house\\nin their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell's\\nsociety, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes\\nseeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her\\nambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her, in having something\\nvery opposite from her inclination fixed on.  She disliked Bath, and\\ndid not think it agreed with her; and Bath was to be her home.\\n\\nSir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt\\nthat he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to\\ndissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\\nat comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath over\\nLondon had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\\ndistance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending\\nsome part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of\\nLady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for\\nBath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should\\nlose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\\n\\nLady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes.  It\\nwould be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in\\nhis own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found the\\nmortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter's\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne's\\ndislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\\nfirst, from the circumstance of her having been three years at school\\nthere, after her mother's death; and secondly, from her happening to be\\nnot in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards\\nspent there with herself.\\n\\nLady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must\\nsuit them all; and as to her young friend's health, by passing all the\\nwarm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided;\\nand it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits\\ngood.  Anne had been too little from home, too little seen. Her spirits\\nwere not high.  A larger society would improve them.  She wanted her to\\nbe more known.\\n\\nThe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for\\nSir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very\\nmaterial part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the\\nbeginning.  He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in the\\nhands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir\\nWalter's have found too much.  Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This,\\nhowever, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their own\\ncircle.\\n\\nSir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to\\ndesign letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word\\n\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned the\\nidea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on the\\nsupposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\nunexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\\nthat he would let it at all.\\n\\nHow quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell\\nhad another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir\\nWalter and his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had\\nbeen lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\\nIt was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an\\nunprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with the additional\\nburden of two children.  She was a clever young woman, who understood\\nthe art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall;\\nand who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been\\nalready staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady\\nRussell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of\\ncaution and reserve.\\n\\nLady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and\\nseemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than because\\nElizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more than\\noutward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had\\nnever succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry, against\\nprevious inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying\\nto get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the\\ninjustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut\\nher out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth\\nthe advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in\\nvain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in\\nmore decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs\\nClay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her\\naffection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her\\nbut the object of distant civility.\\n\\nFrom situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very\\nunequal, and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;\\nand a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice of\\nmore suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore an\\nobject of first-rate importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\n\\n\"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,\" said Mr Shepherd one\\nmorning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper, \"that the\\npresent juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will be turning all\\nour rich naval officers ashore.  They will be all wanting a home.\\nCould not be a better time, Sir Walter, for having a choice of tenants,\\nvery responsible tenants.  Many a noble fortune has been made during\\nthe war.  If a rich admiral were to come in our way, Sir Walter--\"\\n\\n\"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,\" replied Sir Walter; \"that's\\nall I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him;\\nrather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken ever so many\\nbefore; hey, Shepherd?\"\\n\\nMr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--\\n\\n\"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  I have had a little\\nknowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess\\nthat they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make\\ndesirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with.\\nTherefore, Sir Walter, what I would take leave to suggest is, that if\\nin consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which\\nmust be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult\\nit is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the\\nnotice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John\\nShepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody\\nwould think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot\\nhas eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude; and\\ntherefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise\\nme if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get\\nabroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since\\napplications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our\\nwealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave\\nto add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the\\ntrouble of replying.\"\\n\\nSir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the\\nroom, he observed sarcastically--\\n\\n\"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\"\\n\\n\"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\"\\nsaid Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her\\nover, nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to\\nKellynch: \"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might\\nbe a very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the\\nprofession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful\\nin all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter, if\\nyou chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in and\\nabout the house would be taken such excellent care of!  The gardens and\\nshrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now.  You\\nneed not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own sweet flower gardens being\\nneglected.\"\\n\\n\"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced\\nto let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the\\nprivileges to be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to\\nfavour a tenant.  The park would be open to him of course, and few navy\\nofficers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range;\\nbut what restrictions I might impose on the use of the\\npleasure-grounds, is another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my\\nshrubberies being always approachable; and I should recommend Miss\\nElliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden.  I am very\\nlittle disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary\\nfavour, I assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"\\n\\nAfter a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--\\n\\n\"In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything\\nplain and easy between landlord and tenant.  Your interest, Sir Walter,\\nis in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant\\nhas more than his just rights.  I venture to hint, that Sir Walter\\nElliot cannot be half so jealous for his own, as John Shepherd will be\\nfor him.\"\\n\\nHere Anne spoke--\\n\\n\"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an\\nequal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the\\nprivileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough for their\\ncomforts, we must all allow.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,\" was Mr\\nShepherd's rejoinder, and \"Oh! certainly,\" was his daughter's; but Sir\\nWalter's remark was, soon afterwards--\\n\\n\"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any\\nfriend of mine belonging to it.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.\\n\\n\"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of\\nobjection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons of\\nobscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which\\ntheir fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it\\ncuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old\\nsooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.  A man is\\nin greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one\\nwhose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of\\nbecoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other\\nline.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men,\\nstriking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father\\nwe all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was\\nto give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most\\ndeplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of\\nmahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles,\\nnine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top.  'In\\nthe name of heaven, who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of mine\\nwho was standing near, (Sir Basil Morley).  'Old fellow!' cried Sir\\nBasil, 'it is Admiral Baldwin.  What do you take his age to be?'\\n'Sixty,' said I, 'or perhaps sixty-two.' 'Forty,' replied Sir Basil,\\n'forty, and no more.'  Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not\\neasily forget Admiral Baldwin.  I never saw quite so wretched an\\nexample of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is\\nthe same with them all:  they are all knocked about, and exposed to\\nevery climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen.  It\\nis a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach\\nAdmiral Baldwin's age.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Sir Walter,\" cried Mrs Clay, \"this is being severe indeed.  Have\\na little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.\\nThe sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; I\\nhave observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then, is not\\nit the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?  Soldiers,\\nin active service, are not at all better off:  and even in the quieter\\nprofessions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the\\nbody, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural effect of time.\\nThe lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours,\\nand travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman--\" she stopt a\\nmoment to consider what might do for the clergyman;--\"and even the\\nclergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose\\nhis health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In\\nfact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is\\nnecessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who\\nare not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the\\ncountry, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and\\nliving on their own property, without the torment of trying for more;\\nit is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good\\nappearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose\\nsomething of their personableness when they cease to be quite young.\"\\n\\nIt seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter's\\ngood will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted with\\nforesight; for the very first application for the house was from an\\nAdmiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in\\nattending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, he had received\\na hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.  By the report which\\nhe hastened over to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a native of\\nSomersetshire, who having acquired a very handsome fortune, was wishing\\nto settle in his own country, and had come down to Taunton in order to\\nlook at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood, which,\\nhowever, had not suited him; that accidentally hearing--(it was just as\\nhe had foretold, Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could not\\nbe kept a secret,)--accidentally hearing of the possibility of\\nKellynch Hall being to let, and understanding his (Mr Shepherd's)\\nconnection with the owner, he had introduced himself to him in order to\\nmake particular inquiries, and had, in the course of a pretty long\\nconference, expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man\\nwho knew it only by description could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in\\nhis explicit account of himself, every proof of his being a most\\nresponsible, eligible tenant.\\n\\n\"And who is Admiral Croft?\" was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry.\\n\\nMr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family, and\\nmentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,\\nadded--\\n\\n\"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,\\nand has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there, I\\nbelieve, several years.\"\\n\\n\"Then I take it for granted,\" observed Sir Walter, \"that his face is\\nabout as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\"\\n\\nMr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,\\nhearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not\\nmuch, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour; not\\nlikely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a\\ncomfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he must\\npay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that\\nconsequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter\\nhad asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the\\ndeputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he sometimes\\ntook out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all the\\ncircumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him peculiarly\\ndesirable as a tenant.  He was a married man, and without children; the\\nvery state to be wished for.  A house was never taken good care of, Mr\\nShepherd observed, without a lady: he did not know, whether furniture\\nmight not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady, as\\nwhere there were many children.  A lady, without a family, was the very\\nbest preserver of furniture in the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too;\\nshe was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all\\nthe time they were talking the matter over.\\n\\n\"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\"\\ncontinued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms, and\\ntaxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with\\nbusiness; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite\\nunconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she told me\\nso herself: sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at\\nMonkford. Bless me! what was his name? At this moment I cannot\\nrecollect his name, though I have heard it so lately. Penelope, my\\ndear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at\\nMonkford: Mrs Croft's brother?\"\\n\\nBut Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not\\nhear the appeal.\\n\\n\"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember no\\ngentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.\"\\n\\n\"Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.\\nA name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman so\\nwell by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once, I\\nremember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer's man\\nbreaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen; caught in the\\nfact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement, submitted to an\\namicable compromise.  Very odd indeed!\"\\n\\nAfter waiting another moment--\\n\\n\"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?\" said Anne.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was all gratitude.\\n\\n\"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man.  He had\\nthe curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back, for two\\nor three years.  Came there about the year ---5, I take it.  You\\nremember him, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.  You misled\\nme by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of some man of\\nproperty:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember; quite unconnected;\\nnothing to do with the Strafford family.  One wonders how the names of\\nmany of our nobility become so common.\"\\n\\nAs Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no\\nservice with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning, with all\\nhis zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their\\nfavour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea they had\\nformed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for the advantage of\\nrenting it; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the\\nhappiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot: an extraordinary\\ntaste, certainly, could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir\\nWalter's estimate of the dues of a tenant.\\n\\nIt succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an\\nevil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest\\nterms, he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the\\ntreaty, and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still\\nremained at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.\\n\\nSir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough of the\\nworld to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant, in all essentials,\\nthan Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.  So far went his\\nunderstanding; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing, in\\nthe Admiral's situation in life, which was just high enough, and not\\ntoo high.  \"I have let my house to Admiral Croft,\" would sound\\nextremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--; a Mr (save,\\nperhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs a note of\\nexplanation.  An admiral speaks his own consequence, and, at the same\\ntime, can never make a baronet look small.  In all their dealings and\\nintercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence.\\n\\nNothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth: but her\\ninclination was growing so strong for a removal, that she was happy to\\nhave it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand; and not a word to\\nsuspend decision was uttered by her.\\n\\nMr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had such an\\nend been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener to\\nthe whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\nflushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said, with a\\ngentle sigh, \"A few months more, and he, perhaps, may be walking here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\n\\nHe was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, however\\nsuspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his\\nbrother, who being made commander in consequence of the action off St\\nDomingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire, in\\nthe summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home for half\\na year at Monkford.  He was, at that time, a remarkably fine young man,\\nwith a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and Anne an\\nextremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling.\\nHalf the sum of attraction, on either side, might have been enough, for\\nhe had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love; but the\\nencounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.  They were\\ngradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love.\\nIt would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the\\nother, or which had been the happiest: she, in receiving his\\ndeclarations and proposals, or he in having them accepted.\\n\\nA short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.\\nTroubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually\\nwithholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all the\\nnegative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence, and a\\nprofessed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.  He thought it\\na very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with more tempered\\nand pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.\\n\\nAnne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind, to throw\\nherself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement\\nwith a young man, who had nothing but himself to recommend him, and no\\nhopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances of a most uncertain\\nprofession, and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the\\nprofession, would be, indeed, a throwing away, which she grieved to\\nthink of!  Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few, to be snatched off\\nby a stranger without alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by him into a\\nstate of most wearing, anxious, youth-killing dependence!  It must not\\nbe, if by any fair interference of friendship, any representations from\\none who had almost a mother's love, and mother's rights, it would be\\nprevented.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth had no fortune.  He had been lucky in his profession;\\nbut spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.  But\\nhe was confident that he should soon be rich: full of life and ardour,\\nhe knew that he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station that\\nwould lead to everything he wanted.  He had always been lucky; he knew\\nhe should be so still.  Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth,\\nand bewitching in the wit which often expressed it, must have been\\nenough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently.  His\\nsanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on\\nher.  She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a\\ndangerous character to himself.  He was brilliant, he was headstrong.\\nLady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching to\\nimprudence a horror.  She deprecated the connexion in every light.\\n\\nSuch opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than Anne could\\ncombat.  Young and gentle as she was, it might yet have been possible\\nto withstand her father's ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind word\\nor look on the part of her sister; but Lady Russell, whom she had\\nalways loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion,\\nand such tenderness of manner, be continually advising her in vain.\\nShe was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet,\\nimproper, hardly capable of success, and not deserving it.  But it was\\nnot a merely selfish caution, under which she acted, in putting an end\\nto it.  Had she not imagined herself consulting his good, even more\\nthan her own, she could hardly have given him up.  The belief of being\\nprudent, and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief\\nconsolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every\\nconsolation was required, for she had to encounter all the additional\\npain of opinions, on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and\\nof his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment.  He had\\nleft the country in consequence.\\n\\nA few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;\\nbut not with a few months ended Anne's share of suffering from it.  Her\\nattachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment of\\nyouth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting\\neffect.\\n\\nMore than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful\\ninterest had reached its close; and time had softened down much,\\nperhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him, but she had been too\\ndependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place\\n(except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture), or in any novelty\\nor enlargement of society.  No one had ever come within the Kellynch\\ncircle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as he\\nstood in her memory.  No second attachment, the only thoroughly\\nnatural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been\\npossible to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste,\\nin the small limits of the society around them.  She had been\\nsolicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change her name, by the young\\nman, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger\\nsister; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove\\nwas the eldest son of a man, whose landed property and general\\nimportance were second in that country, only to Sir Walter's, and of\\ngood character and appearance; and however Lady Russell might have\\nasked yet for something more, while Anne was nineteen, she would have\\nrejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the\\npartialities and injustice of her father's house, and settled so\\npermanently near herself.  But in this case, Anne had left nothing for\\nadvice to do; and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her\\nown discretion, never wished the past undone, she began now to have the\\nanxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some\\nman of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held\\nher to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.\\n\\nThey knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change,\\non the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never\\nalluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen.  She did not blame\\nLady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;\\nbut she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to\\napply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain\\nimmediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.  She was persuaded\\nthat under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every\\nanxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, and\\ndisappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman in\\nmaintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;\\nand this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it\\nhappened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be\\nreasonably calculated on.  All his sanguine expectations, all his\\nconfidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour had seemed to\\nforesee and to command his prosperous path.  He had, very soon after\\ntheir engagement ceased, got employ: and all that he had told her would\\nfollow, had taken place.  He had distinguished himself, and early\\ngained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures,\\nhave made a handsome fortune.  She had only navy lists and newspapers\\nfor her authority, but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in\\nfavour of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married.\\n\\nHow eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least, were\\nher wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful\\nconfidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems\\nto insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She had been forced into\\nprudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the\\nnatural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\\n\\nWith all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she could not\\nhear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely to live at Kellynch\\nwithout a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh,\\nwere necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.  She often told\\nherself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves sufficiently\\nto feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no\\nevil.  She was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and\\napparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends in\\nthe secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of\\nit.  She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell's motives\\nin this, over those of her father and Elizabeth; she could honour all\\nthe better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivion\\namong them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the\\nevent of Admiral Croft's really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew\\nover the conviction which had always been most grateful to her, of the\\npast being known to those three only among her connexions, by whom no\\nsyllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that\\namong his, the brother only with whom he had been residing, had\\nreceived any information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother\\nhad been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and,\\nmoreover, a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no\\nhuman creature's having heard of it from him.\\n\\nThe sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying her\\nhusband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary, had been at\\nschool while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some,\\nand the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards.\\n\\nWith these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\nand the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,\\nand Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need not\\ninvolve any particular awkwardness.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\n\\nOn the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch\\nHall, Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady\\nRussell's, and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it\\nmost natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing\\nthem.\\n\\nThis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory, and decided\\nthe whole business at once.  Each lady was previously well disposed for\\nan agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but good manners in the\\nother; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty good\\nhumour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral's side, as\\ncould not but influence Sir Walter, who had besides been flattered into\\nhis very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurances\\nof his being known, by report, to the Admiral, as a model of good\\nbreeding.\\n\\nThe house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts were\\napproved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right; and Mr\\nShepherd's clerks were set to work, without there having been a single\\npreliminary difference to modify of all that \"This indenture sheweth.\"\\n\\nSir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be the\\nbest-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair, he should\\nnot be ashamed of being seen with him any where; and the Admiral, with\\nsympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife as they drove back through\\nthe park, \"I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite\\nof what they told us at Taunton.  The Baronet will never set the Thames\\non fire, but there seems to be no harm in him.\"--reciprocal\\ncompliments, which would have been esteemed about equal.\\n\\nThe Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter\\nproposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month, there\\nwas no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.\\n\\nLady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any\\nuse, or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were\\ngoing to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\nconvey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements of\\nher own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks, she was\\nunable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne though dreading\\nthe possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath, and\\ngrieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the\\nautumnal months in the country, did not think that, everything\\nconsidered, she wished to remain.  It would be most right, and most\\nwise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others.\\n\\nSomething occurred, however, to give her a different duty.  Mary, often\\na little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her own\\ncomplaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was\\nthe matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she should not have a\\nday's health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her, for it\\nwas hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear her\\ncompany as long as she should want her, instead of going to Bath.\\n\\n\"I cannot possibly do without Anne,\" was Mary's reasoning; and\\nElizabeth's reply was, \"Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobody\\nwill want her in Bath.\"\\n\\nTo be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to be\\nthought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and\\ncertainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her own\\ndear country, readily agreed to stay.\\n\\nThis invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties, and\\nit was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till\\nLady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time should be\\ndivided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.\\n\\nSo far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled by\\nthe wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her,\\nwhich was, Mrs Clay's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and\\nElizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in\\nall the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry that\\nsuch a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved,\\nand feared; and the affront it contained to Anne, in Mrs Clay's being\\nof so much use, while Anne could be of none, was a very sore\\naggravation.\\n\\nAnne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt the\\nimprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.  With a\\ngreat deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she often\\nwished less, of her father's character, she was sensible that results\\nthe most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than\\npossible.  She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea\\nof the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a\\nclumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in\\nher absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking,\\nand possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners,\\ninfinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might\\nhave been.  Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that\\nshe could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her\\nsister.  She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the\\nevent of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than\\nherself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for\\ngiving no warning.\\n\\nShe spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elizabeth could not conceive how\\nsuch an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answered\\nfor each party's perfectly knowing their situation.\\n\\n\"Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is; and as I am\\nrather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can\\nassure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly\\nnice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more\\nstrongly than most people.  And as to my father, I really should not\\nhave thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for our\\nsakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman,\\nI grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that\\nanything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a\\ndegrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clay\\nwho, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably\\npretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect\\nsafety.  One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her\\npersonal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times.  That tooth\\nof her's and those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much\\nas they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a\\nfew, but he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay's\\nfreckles.\"\\n\\n\"There is hardly any personal defect,\" replied Anne, \"which an\\nagreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"\\n\\n\"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly; \"an agreeable\\nmanner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones.\\nHowever, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this\\npoint than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you\\nto be advising me.\"\\n\\nAnne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of\\ndoing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be\\nmade observant by it.\\n\\nThe last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,\\nMiss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath. The party drove off in very good\\nspirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the\\nafflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show\\nthemselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate\\ntranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\\n\\nHer friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt\\nthis break-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was as\\ndear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become precious by\\nhabit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and still\\nworse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escape\\nthe solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be out\\nof the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived, she had determined\\nto make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne.\\nAccordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down at\\nUppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell's journey.\\n\\nUppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had\\nbeen completely in the old English style, containing only two houses\\nsuperior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the\\nmansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,\\nsubstantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,\\nenclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained\\nround its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire, it had\\nreceived the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for\\nhis residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French\\nwindows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the\\ntraveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and\\npremises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\\n\\nHere Anne had often been staying. She knew the ways of Uppercross as\\nwell as those of Kellynch. The two families were so continually\\nmeeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's\\nhouse at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary\\nalone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\na matter of course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary\\nhad not Anne's understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, and\\nproperly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely. She had no resources for\\nsolitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot\\nself-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of\\nfancying herself neglected and ill-used. In person, she was inferior to\\nboth sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity of\\nbeing \"a fine girl.\" She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty\\nlittle drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been\\ngradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two\\nchildren; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with--\\n\\n\"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.  I\\nam so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature the whole\\nmorning!\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne.  \"You sent me such a\\ngood account of yourself on Thursday!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well\\nat the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have\\nbeen all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.\\nSuppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not\\nable to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.  I do not\\nthink she has been in this house three times this summer.\"\\n\\nAnne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.  \"Oh!\\nCharles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o'clock.  He\\nwould go, though I told him how ill I was.  He said he should not stay\\nout long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.  I\\nassure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"\\n\\n\"You have had your little boys with you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable\\nthat they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind a\\nword I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully.  \"You\\nknow I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours at the\\nGreat House?\"\\n\\n\"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them\\nto-day, except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the\\nwindow, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how\\nill I was, not one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to\\nsuit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves out\\nof their way.\"\\n\\n\"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.  It is\\nearly.\"\\n\\n\"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal too\\nmuch for me.  Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind of\\nyou not to come on Thursday.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of\\nyourself!  You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were\\nperfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you\\nmust be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the\\nlast: and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so\\nbusy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have\\nleft Kellynch sooner.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\"\\n\\n\"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect in a\\nmoment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making a duplicate of the\\ncatalogue of my father's books and pictures.  I have been several times\\nin the garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make him\\nunderstand, which of Elizabeth's plants are for Lady Russell.  I have\\nhad all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide,\\nand all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what\\nwas intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Mary,\\nof a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as\\na sort of take-leave.  I was told that they wished it.  But all these\\nthings took up a great deal of time.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! well!\" and after a moment's pause, \"but you have never asked me\\none word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you\\nmust have been obliged to give up the party.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter\\nwith me till this morning.  It would have been strange if I had not\\ngone.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant\\nparty.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will\\nbe, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a\\ncarriage of one's own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were so\\ncrowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr\\nMusgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into the back\\nseat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely that my\\nillness to-day may be owing to it.\"\\n\\nA little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on\\nAnne's side produced nearly a cure on Mary's.  She could soon sit\\nupright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able to leave it by\\ndinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it, she was at the other end\\nof the room, beautifying a nosegay; then, she ate her cold meat; and\\nthen she was well enough to propose a little walk.\\n\\n\"Where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"I suppose you\\nwill not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"I have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied Anne.  \"I\\nshould never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so\\nwell as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.  They ought\\nto feel what is due to you as my sister.  However, we may as well go\\nand sit with them a little  while, and when we have that over, we can\\nenjoy our walk.\"\\n\\nAnne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neither\\nfamily could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly they\\nwent, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughters\\nof the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a\\ngrand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in\\nevery direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits against the\\nwainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue\\nsatin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an\\noverthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves seemed\\nto be staring in astonishment.\\n\\nThe Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,\\nperhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old English\\nstyle, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a\\nvery good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated,\\nand not at all elegant.  Their children had more modern minds and\\nmanners.  There was a numerous family; but the only two grown up,\\nexcepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteen\\nand twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock\\nof accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies,\\nliving to be fashionable, happy, and merry.  Their dress had every\\nadvantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely\\ngood, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence\\nat home, and favourites abroad.  Anne always contemplated them as some\\nof the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we\\nall are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for\\nthe possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more\\nelegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them\\nnothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement\\ntogether, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\\nso little herself with either of her sisters.\\n\\nThey were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss on the\\nside of the Great House family, which was generally, as Anne very well\\nknew, the least to blame.  The half hour was chatted away pleasantly\\nenough; and she was not at all surprised, at the end of it, to have\\ntheir walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's\\nparticular invitation.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\n\\nAnne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal\\nfrom one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three\\nmiles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and\\nidea.  She had never been staying there before, without being struck by\\nit, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in\\nseeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at\\nKellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading\\ninterest; yet, with all this experience, she believed she must now\\nsubmit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own\\nnothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her; for\\ncertainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject which\\nhad been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in\\nthe separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: \"So, Miss\\nAnne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you\\nthink they will settle in?\" and this, without much waiting for an\\nanswer; or in the young ladies' addition of, \"I hope we shall be in\\nBath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a\\ngood situation:  none of your Queen Squares for us!\" or in the anxious\\nsupplement from Mary, of--\"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off,\\nwhen you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!\"\\n\\nShe could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think\\nwith heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one\\nsuch truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.\\n\\nThe Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own\\nhorses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully\\noccupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours,\\ndress, dancing, and music.  She acknowledged it to be very fitting,\\nthat every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of\\ndiscourse; and hoped, ere long, to become a not unworthy member of the\\none she was now transplanted into.  With the prospect of spending at\\nleast two months at Uppercross, it was highly incumbent on her to\\nclothe her imagination, her memory, and all her ideas in as much of\\nUppercross as possible.\\n\\nShe had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive and\\nunsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts of the\\ncottage inimical to comfort.  She was always on friendly terms with her\\nbrother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and\\nrespected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object of\\ninterest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.\\n\\nCharles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,\\nor grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a\\ndangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anne could believe,\\nwith Lady Russell, that a more equal match might have greatly improved\\nhim; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more\\nconsequence to his character, and more usefulness, rationality, and\\nelegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was, he did nothing with\\nmuch zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without\\nbenefit from books or anything else.  He had very good spirits, which\\nnever seemed much affected by his wife's occasional lowness, bore with\\nher unreasonableness sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the\\nwhole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she\\nhad sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by both\\nparties), they might pass for a happy couple.  They were always\\nperfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination\\nfor a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he\\nhad the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such\\na present was not made, he always contended for his father's having\\nmany other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked.\\n\\nAs to the management of their children, his theory was much better than\\nhis wife's, and his practice not so bad.  \"I could manage them very\\nwell, if it were not for Mary's interference,\" was what Anne often\\nheard him say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in\\nturn to Mary's reproach of \"Charles spoils the children so that I\\ncannot get them into any order,\" she never had the smallest temptation\\nto say, \"Very true.\"\\n\\nOne of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her\\nbeing treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too\\nmuch in the secret of the complaints of each house.  Known to have some\\ninfluence with her sister, she was continually requested, or at least\\nreceiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.  \"I wish you\\ncould persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\" was\\nCharles's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary: \"I do\\nbelieve if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think there was\\nanything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would, you might\\npersuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse than I ever\\nown.\"\\n\\nMary's declaration was, \"I hate sending the children to the Great\\nHouse, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she\\nhumours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much\\ntrash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\nfor the rest of the day.\"  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity\\nof being alone with Anne, to say, \"Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing\\nMrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.  They are\\nquite different creatures with you!  But to be sure, in general they\\nare so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of\\nmanaging them.  They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen,\\npoor little dears! without partiality; but Mrs Charles knows no more\\nhow they should be treated--!  Bless me! how troublesome they are\\nsometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see them\\nat our house so often as I otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is\\nnot quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is\\nvery bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\nevery moment; \"don't do this,\" and \"don't do that;\" or that one can\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\"\\n\\nShe had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  \"Mrs Musgrove thinks\\nall her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in\\nquestion; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper\\nhouse-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are\\ngadding about the village, all day long.  I meet them wherever I go;\\nand I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing\\nsomething of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiest\\ncreature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; for she tells\\nme, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\" And on Mrs\\nMusgrove's side, it was, \"I make a rule of never interfering in any of\\nmy daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall\\ntell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights,\\nthat I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid: I hear\\nstrange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from my own\\nknowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady, that she is\\nenough to ruin any servants she comes near.  Mrs Charles quite swears\\nby her, I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the\\nwatch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of\\nmentioning it.\"\\n\\nAgain, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to\\ngive her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the Great\\nHouse with other families; and she did not see any reason why she was\\nto be considered so much at home as to lose her place.  And one day\\nwhen Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after\\ntalking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, \"I have no\\nscruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about\\ntheir place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you\\nare about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would\\nbe a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially if\\nshe would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.\\nNobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be\\nmore becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.  It is not that\\nmamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken\\nnotice of by many persons.\"\\n\\nHow was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do little\\nmore than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to\\nthe other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between\\nsuch near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant\\nfor her sister's benefit.\\n\\nIn all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.  Her\\nown spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed\\nthree miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened by having a\\nconstant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family,\\nsince there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment\\nin the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.  It\\nwas certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every\\nmorning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed\\nthey should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs\\nMusgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without the\\ntalking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\\n\\nShe played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but\\nhaving no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit\\nby and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought\\nof, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well\\naware.  She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to\\nherself; but this was no new sensation.  Excepting one short period of\\nher life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the\\nloss of her dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or\\nencouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.  In music she had\\nbeen always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's\\nfond partiality for their own daughters' performance, and total\\nindifference to any other person's, gave her much more pleasure for\\ntheir sakes, than mortification for her own.\\n\\nThe party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.\\nThe neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by\\neverybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors\\nby invitation and by chance, than any other family.  They were more\\ncompletely popular.\\n\\nThe girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,\\nin an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins within\\na walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on\\nthe Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come at any time,\\nand help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much\\npreferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country\\ndances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always\\nrecommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nmore than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--\"Well done,\\nMiss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!  how those little\\nfingers of yours fly about!\"\\n\\nSo passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart\\nmust be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others; all the\\nprecious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own\\nother eyes and other limbs!  She could not think of much else on the\\n29th of September; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening\\nfrom Mary, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month,\\nexclaimed, \"Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to\\nKellynch?  I am glad I did not think of it before.  How low it makes\\nme!\"\\n\\nThe Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to be\\nvisited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.  \"Nobody knew how\\nmuch she should suffer.  She should put it off as long as she could;\"\\nbut was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on\\nan early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of\\nimaginary agitation, when she came back.  Anne had very sincerely\\nrejoiced in there being no means of her going.  She wished, however to\\nsee the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.\\nThey came:  the master of the house was not at home, but the two\\nsisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the\\nshare of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very\\nagreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was well\\nable to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, to\\ncatch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.\\n\\nMrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness,\\nand vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.  She had\\nbright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though\\nher reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her\\nhaving been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have\\nlived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.\\nHer manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust\\nof herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to\\ncoarseness, however, or any want of good humour.  Anne gave her credit,\\nindeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all\\nthat related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she had\\nsatisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of\\nintroduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge\\nor suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias of any sort.  She was\\nquite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage,\\ntill for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--\\n\\n\"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the\\npleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"\\n\\nAnne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion\\nshe certainly had not.\\n\\n\"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft.\\n\\nShe could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs\\nCroft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke,\\nthat she had said nothing which might not do for either brother. She\\nimmediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Croft should be\\nthinking and speaking of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shame\\nat her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their\\nformer neighbour's present state with proper interest.\\n\\nThe rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she\\nheard the Admiral say to Mary--\\n\\n\"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say you\\nknow him by name.\"\\n\\nHe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to\\nhim like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being too\\nmuch engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets,\\n&c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had\\nbegun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, that\\nthe same brother must still be in question.  She could not, however,\\nreach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether\\nanything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the\\nCrofts had previously been calling.\\n\\nThe folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at\\nthe Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to\\nbe made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the\\nyoungest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming to apologize,\\nand that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the\\nfirst black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisa\\nmade all right by saying, that she only came on foot, to leave more\\nroom for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\\n\\n\"And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.  I am\\ncome on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this\\nevening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor Richard!\\nAnd we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse\\nher more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you why she is out of\\nspirits.  When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here\\nafterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that her brother,\\nCaptain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or\\nsomething, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most\\nunluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone, that\\nWentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard's\\ncaptain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while\\nbefore he died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over his letters and\\nthings, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be\\nthe very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!\\nSo we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon\\nsuch gloomy things.\"\\n\\nThe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,\\nthat the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,\\nhopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his\\ntwentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and\\nunmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any\\ntime by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard\\nof, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death\\nabroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.\\n\\nHe had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for\\nhim, by calling him \"poor Richard,\" been nothing better than a\\nthick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done\\nanything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,\\nliving or dead.\\n\\nHe had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those\\nremovals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such\\nmidshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on\\nboard Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the\\nLaconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only\\ntwo letters which his father and mother had ever received from him\\nduring the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two\\ndisinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for\\nmoney.\\n\\nIn each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little\\nwere they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and\\nincurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made\\nscarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have\\nbeen suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of\\nWentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary\\nbursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\\n\\nShe had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the\\nre-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son\\ngone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had\\naffected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for\\nhim than she had known on first hearing of his death.  Mr Musgrove was,\\nin a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the\\ncottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew\\non this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful\\ncompanions could give them.\\n\\nTo hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name\\nso often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it\\nmight, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain\\nWentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their\\ncoming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say\\nwhether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to\\nAnne's nerves.  She found, however, that it was one to which she must\\ninure herself.  Since he actually was expected in the country, she must\\nteach herself to be insensible on such points.  And not only did it\\nappear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their\\nwarm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high\\nrespect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been\\nsix months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though not\\nperfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow, only two\\nperticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on introducing\\nthemselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of\\nhis arrival.\\n\\nThe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\nA very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at\\nKellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his\\npraise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by\\nthe end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment to Mr\\nMusgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was\\nhe to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own\\nroof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his\\ncellars.  But a week must pass; only a week, in Anne's reckoning, and\\nthen, she supposed, they must meet; and soon she began to wish that she\\ncould feel secure even for a week.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour.  She and Mary\\nwere actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as she\\nafterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him, when they were\\nstopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment brought home in\\nconsequence of a bad fall.  The child's situation put the visit\\nentirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference,\\neven in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on\\nhis account.\\n\\nHis collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in\\nthe back, as roused the most alarming ideas.  It was an afternoon of\\ndistress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to\\nsend for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to\\nsupport and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest\\nchild to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe;\\nbesides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to the\\nother house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened,\\nenquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.\\n\\nHer brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care of\\nhis wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.\\nTill he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the\\nworse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;\\nbut now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson felt\\nand felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the\\nfather and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be\\nable to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then\\nit was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so\\nfar to digress from their nephew's state, as to give the information of\\nCaptain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind their father and\\nmother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with\\nhim, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought him\\nthan any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all\\na favourite before.  How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to\\nstay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, and\\nhow glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma's\\nfarther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the\\nmorrow--actually on the morrow; and he had promised it in so pleasant a\\nmanner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he\\nought.  And in short, he had looked and said everything with such\\nexquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both\\nturned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and\\napparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.\\n\\nThe same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls\\ncame with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make\\nenquiries; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about\\nhis heir, could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would\\nbe now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry\\nto think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the\\nlittle boy, to give him the meeting.  \"Oh no; as to leaving the little\\nboy,\" both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\nto bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not help\\nadding her warm protestations to theirs.\\n\\nCharles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; \"the\\nchild was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced to\\nCaptain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening; he\\nwould not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\" But\\nin this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"Oh! no, indeed,\\nCharles, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anything\\nshould happen?\"\\n\\nThe child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.  It\\nmust be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the\\nspine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm, and Charles\\nMusgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longer\\nconfinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as\\npossible; but what was there for a father to do?  This was quite a\\nfemale case, and it would be highly absurd in him, who could be of no\\nuse at home, to shut himself up.  His father very much wished him to\\nmeet Captain Wentworth, and there being no sufficient reason against\\nit, he ought to go; and it ended in his making a bold, public\\ndeclaration, when he came in from shooting, of his meaning to dress\\ndirectly, and dine at the other house.\\n\\n\"Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he; \"so I told my\\nfather, just now, that I would come, and he thought me quite right.\\nYour sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.  You\\nwould not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.\\nAnne will send for me if anything is the matter.\"\\n\\nHusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.\\nMary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he was quite\\ndetermined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.  She\\nsaid nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon as\\nthere was only Anne to hear--\\n\\n\"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick\\nchild; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!  I knew how\\nit would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is anything\\ndisagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles\\nis as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say it is very\\nunfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.  Talks of\\nhis being going on so well!  How does he know that he is going on well,\\nor that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?  I did not\\nthink Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to go away\\nand enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be\\nallowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else\\nto be about the child.  My being the mother is the very reason why my\\nfeelings should not be tried.  I am not at all equal to it.  You saw\\nhow hysterical I was yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of the\\nshock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have\\nnothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's\\ndirections, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at\\nyour husband.  Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his\\nprovince.  A sick child is always the mother's property:  her own\\nfeelings generally make it so.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know that\\nI am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles, for I cannot be\\nalways scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw,\\nthis morning, that if I told him to keep quiet, he was sure to begin\\nkicking about.  I have not nerves for the sort of thing.\"\\n\\n\"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole\\nevening away from the poor boy?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is so\\ncareful; and she could send us word every hour how he was.  I really\\nthink Charles might as well have told his father we would all come.  I\\nam not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.  I was\\ndreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,\\nsuppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charles\\nto my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain\\nwith him.\"\\n\\n\"Are you serious?\" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  \"Dear me!  that's\\na very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure, I may just as well\\ngo as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?  and it only harasses me.\\nYou, who have not a mother's feelings, are a great deal the properest\\nperson.  You can make little Charles do anything; he always minds you\\nat a word.  It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with\\nJemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as\\nmuch as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with\\nCaptain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone.  An\\nexcellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles,\\nand get ready directly.  You can send for us, you know, at a moment's\\nnotice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing\\nto alarm you.  I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel\\nquite at ease about my dear child.\"\\n\\nThe next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room door,\\nand as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for the whole\\nconversation, which began with Mary's saying, in a tone of great\\nexultation--\\n\\n\"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home than\\nyou are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should\\nnot be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.  Anne will\\nstay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.  It is\\nAnne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great\\ndeal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"This is very kind of Anne,\" was her husband's answer, \"and I should be\\nvery glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be\\nleft at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\"\\n\\nAnne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity of her\\nmanner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction was at\\nleast very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being left\\nto dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her to\\nlet him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable; and this\\nbeing the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off\\ntogether in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped, to be happy,\\nhowever oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself,\\nshe was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever\\nlikely to be hers.  She knew herself to be of the first utility to the\\nchild; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a\\nmile distant, making himself agreeable to others?\\n\\nShe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.  Perhaps\\nindifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.  He\\nmust be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished ever to see her\\nagain, he need not have waited till this time; he would have done what\\nshe could not but believe that in his place she should have done long\\nago, when events had been early giving him the independence which alone\\nhad been wanting.\\n\\nHer brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,\\nand their visit in general.  There had been music, singing, talking,\\nlaughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in Captain\\nWentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other\\nperfectly, and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with\\nCharles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though\\nthat had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed to come\\nto the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs\\nCharles Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore,\\nsomehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet him\\nto breakfast at his father's.\\n\\nAnne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquired\\nafter her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight\\nacquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged,\\nactuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they\\nwere to meet.\\n\\nThe morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the\\nother house, and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary\\nand Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to\\nsay that they were just setting off, that he was come for his dogs,\\nthat his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth; his sisters\\nmeaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposing\\nalso to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and though\\nCharles had answered for the child's being in no such state as could\\nmake it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without\\nhis running on to give notice.\\n\\nMary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive\\nhim, while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was the\\nmost consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.  In\\ntwo minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared; they were\\nin the drawing-room.  Her eye half met Captain Wentworth's, a bow, a\\ncurtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary, said all that\\nwas right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy\\nfooting; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few\\nminutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself at the window, all was ready,\\ntheir visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too,\\nsuddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the\\nsportsmen:  the room was cleared, and Anne might finish her breakfast\\nas she could.\\n\\n\"It is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again, in\\nnervous gratitude.  \"The worst is over!\"\\n\\nMary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.  They had\\nmet.  They had been once more in the same room.\\n\\nSoon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling\\nless.  Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been\\ngiven up.  How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an\\ninterval had banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not\\neight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,\\nremovals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--\\nhow natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part of her\\nown life.\\n\\nAlas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings\\neight years may be little more than nothing.\\n\\nNow, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like wishing to\\navoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly\\nwhich asked the question.\\n\\nOn one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have\\nprevented, she was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss\\nMusgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had\\nthis spontaneous information from Mary:--\\n\\n\"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was so\\nattentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you, when they\\nwent away, and he said, 'You were so altered he should not have known\\nyou again.'\"\\n\\nMary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common way,\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar\\nwound.\\n\\n\"Altered beyond his knowledge.\"  Anne fully submitted, in silent, deep\\nmortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge, for\\nhe was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already acknowledged\\nit to herself, and she could not think differently, let him think of\\nher as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed her youth and\\nbloom had only given him a more glowing, manly, open look, in no\\nrespect lessening his personal advantages.  She had seen the same\\nFrederick Wentworth.\\n\\n\"So altered that he should not have known her again!\"  These were words\\nwhich could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice that\\nshe had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency; they allayed\\nagitation; they composed, and consequently must make her happier.\\n\\nFrederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but\\nwithout an idea that they would be carried round to her.  He had\\nthought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, had\\nspoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.  She had used him\\nill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse, she had shewn a\\nfeebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confident\\ntemper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.  It\\nhad been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been weakness and\\ntimidity.\\n\\nHe had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman\\nsince whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural\\nsensation of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Her\\npower with him was gone for ever.\\n\\nIt was now his object to marry.  He was rich, and being turned on\\nshore, fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly\\ntempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the\\nspeed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heart\\nfor either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in\\nshort, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way, excepting Anne\\nElliot.  This was his only secret exception, when he said to his\\nsister, in answer to her suppositions:--\\n\\n\"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.  Anybody\\nbetween fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.  A little beauty,\\nand a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost\\nman.  Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society\\namong women to make him nice?\"\\n\\nHe said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  His bright proud eye spoke\\nthe conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was not out of his\\nthoughts, when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to\\nmeet with.  \"A strong mind, with sweetness of manner,\" made the first\\nand the last of the description.\\n\\n\"That is the woman I want,\" said he.  \"Something a little inferior I\\nshall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,\\nI shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than\\nmost men.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\n\\nFrom this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the\\nsame circle.  They were soon dining in company together at Mr\\nMusgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer supply his aunt\\nwith a pretence for absenting herself; and this was but the beginning\\nof other dinings and other meetings.\\n\\nWhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the\\nproof; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of\\neach; they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement\\ncould not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions\\nwhich conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him, his\\ndisposition lead him, to talk; and \"That was in the year six;\" \"That\\nhappened before I went to sea in the year six,\" occurred in the course\\nof the first evening they spent together: and though his voice did not\\nfalter, and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering\\ntowards her while he spoke, Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her\\nknowledge of his mind, that he could be unvisited by remembrance any\\nmore than herself.  There must be the same immediate association of\\nthought, though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.\\n\\nThey had no conversation together, no intercourse but what the\\ncommonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!  Now nothing!\\nThere had been a time, when of all the large party now filling the\\ndrawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult to\\ncease to speak to one another.  With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral\\nand Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anne could\\nallow no other exceptions even among the married couples), there could\\nhave been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so\\nin unison, no countenances so beloved.  Now they were as strangers;\\nnay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted.  It\\nwas a perpetual estrangement.\\n\\nWhen he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.\\nThere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the\\nparty; and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss\\nMusgroves, who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the\\nmanner of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and\\ntheir surprise at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation\\nand arrangement which was practicable, drew from him some pleasant\\nridicule, which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been\\nignorant, and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be\\nliving on board without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if\\nthere were, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.\\n\\nFrom thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper of Mrs\\nMusgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--\\n\\n\"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son, I dare\\nsay he would have been just such another by this time.\"\\n\\nAnne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove\\nrelieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others.\\n\\nWhen she could let her attention take its natural course again, she\\nfound the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List (their own navy\\nlist, the first that had ever been at Uppercross), and sitting down\\ntogether to pore over it, with the professed view of finding out the\\nships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.\\n\\n\"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find her there.  Quite worn out and broken up.  I was the\\nlast man who commanded her.  Hardly fit for service then.  Reported fit\\nfor home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off to the West\\nIndies.\"\\n\\nThe girls looked all amazement.\\n\\n\"The Admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then, with\\nsending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.\\nBut they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands that\\nmay just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to\\ndistinguish the very set who may be least missed.\"\\n\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" cried the Admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!\\nNever was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old built\\nsloop, you would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knows\\nthere must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at\\nthe same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon, with no more\\ninterest than his.\"\\n\\n\"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;\" replied Captain Wentworth,\\nseriously.  \"I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can\\ndesire.  It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea; a\\nvery great object, I wanted to be doing something.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore for\\nhalf a year together?  If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to be\\nafloat again.\"\\n\\n\"But, Captain Wentworth,\" cried Louisa, \"how vexed you must have been\\nwhen you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\"\\n\\n\"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling.\\n\"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the\\nfashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent about\\namong half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and which\\nat last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.  Ah! she was a dear\\nold Asp to me.  She did all that I wanted.  I knew she would.  I knew\\nthat we should either go to the bottom together, or that she would be\\nthe making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time\\nI was at sea in her; and after taking privateers enough to be very\\nentertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn,\\nto fall in with the very French frigate I wanted.  I brought her into\\nPlymouth; and here another instance of luck.  We had not been six hours\\nin the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights,\\nand which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch\\nwith the Great Nation not having much improved our condition.\\nFour-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant\\nCaptain Wentworth, in a small paragraph at one corner of the\\nnewspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thought\\nabout me.\" Anne's shudderings were to herself alone; but the Miss\\nMusgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamations\\nof pity and horror.\\n\\n\"And so then, I suppose,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice, as if\\nthinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the Laconia, and there he met\\nwith our poor boy. Charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her), \"do ask\\nCaptain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.  I\\nalways forgot.\"\\n\\n\"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at\\nGibraltar, with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain\\nWentworth.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid of\\nmentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure to\\nhear him talked of by such a good friend.\"\\n\\nCharles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,\\nonly nodded in reply, and walked away.\\n\\nThe girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could\\nnot deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his\\nown hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud the little\\nstatement of her name and rate, and present non-commissioned class,\\nobserving over it that she too had been one of the best friends man\\never had.\\n\\n\"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I made\\nmoney in her.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together\\noff the Western Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!  You know how much he\\nwanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.  Excellent fellow.  I\\nshall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all, so much for her\\nsake.  I wished for him again the next summer, when I had still the\\nsame luck in the Mediterranean.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure, Sir,\" said Mrs Musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget what\\nyou did.\"\\n\\nHer feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only in\\npart, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts,\\nlooked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.\\n\\n\"My brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking of poor\\nRichard.\"\\n\\n\"Poor dear fellow!\" continued Mrs Musgrove; \"he was grown so steady,\\nand such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!  Ah!\\nit would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.  I assure\\nyou, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"\\n\\nThere was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this\\nspeech, a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome\\nmouth, which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's\\nkind wishes, as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get\\nrid of him; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to\\nbe detected by any who understood him less than herself; in another\\nmoment he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly\\nafterwards coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were\\nsitting, took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with\\nher, in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy and\\nnatural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was\\nreal and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.\\n\\nThey were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily\\nmade room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.  It was no\\ninsignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable,\\nsubstantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good\\ncheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment; and while the\\nagitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered\\nas very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some\\ncredit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat\\nsighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.\\n\\nPersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary\\nproportions.  A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep\\naffliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair\\nor not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will\\npatronize in vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will\\nseize.\\n\\nThe Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\nwith his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife, now came\\nup to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what he might\\nbe interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts, began with--\\n\\n\"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick, you\\nwould have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her\\ndaughters.\"\\n\\n\"Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then.\"\\n\\nThe Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on\\nboard a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit, which a few\\nhours might comprehend.\\n\\n\"But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry\\ntowards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with all\\none's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make the accommodations on\\nboard such as women ought to have.  There can be no want of gallantry,\\nAdmiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high,\\nand this is what I do.  I hate to hear of women on board, or to see\\nthem on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family\\nof ladies anywhere, if I can help it.\"\\n\\nThis brought his sister upon him.\\n\\n\"Oh! Frederick!  But I cannot believe it of you.--All idle\\nrefinement!--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house\\nin England.  I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and\\nI know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I\\ndeclare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at\\nKellynch Hall,\" (with a kind bow to Anne), \"beyond what I always had in\\nmost of the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother.  \"You were living with\\nyour husband, and were the only woman on board.\"\\n\\n\"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin, and\\nthree children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this\\nsuperfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\"\\n\\n\"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any brother\\nofficer's wife that I could, and I would bring anything of Harville's\\nfrom the world's end, if he wanted it.  But do not imagine that I did\\nnot feel it an evil in itself.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\"\\n\\n\"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number of\\nwomen and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what would\\nbecome of us poor sailors' wives, who often want to be conveyed to one\\nport or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\"\\n\\n\"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all\\nher family to Plymouth.\"\\n\\n\"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if\\nwomen were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.  We none of\\nus expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear,\" said the Admiral, \"when he had got a wife, he will sing\\na different tune.  When he is married, if we have the good luck to live\\nto another war, we shall see him do as you and I, and a great many\\nothers, have done.  We shall have him very thankful to anybody that\\nwill bring him his wife.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, that we shall.\"\\n\\n\"Now I have done,\" cried Captain Wentworth.  \"When once married people\\nbegin to attack me with,--'Oh! you will think very differently, when\\nyou are married.'  I can only say, 'No, I shall not;' and then they say\\nagain, 'Yes, you will,' and there is an end of it.\"\\n\\nHe got up and moved away.\\n\\n\"What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!\" said Mrs Musgrove\\nto Mrs Croft.\\n\\n\"Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many\\nwomen have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have\\nbeen once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besides\\nbeing in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.\\nBut I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the West\\nIndies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the West Indies.\"\\n\\nMrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse\\nherself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her\\nlife.\\n\\n\"And I do assure you, ma'am,\" pursued Mrs Croft, \"that nothing can\\nexceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the\\nhigher rates.  When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more\\nconfined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of\\nthem; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been\\nspent on board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was\\nnothing to be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with\\nexcellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little\\ndisordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but\\nnever knew what sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really\\nsuffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself\\nunwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by\\nmyself at Deal, when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North\\nSeas.  I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when I\\nshould hear from him next; but as long as we could be together, nothing\\never ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,\\nMrs Croft,\" was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer.  \"There is nothing so bad\\nas a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is, for\\nMr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they are\\nover, and he is safe back again.\"\\n\\nThe evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed, Anne offered\\nher services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with\\ntears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad to be\\nemployed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\\n\\nIt was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits than\\nCaptain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate him\\nwhich general attention and deference, and especially the attention of\\nall the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females of the\\nfamily of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to the\\nhonour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa, they\\nboth seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but the continued\\nappearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have\\nmade it credible that they were not decided rivals.  If he were a\\nlittle spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could\\nwonder?\\n\\nThese were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers\\nwere mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,\\nequally without error, and without consciousness.  Once she felt that\\nhe was looking at herself,  observing her altered features, perhaps,\\ntrying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed\\nhim; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her; she was hardly\\naware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was sure of his\\nhaving asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?  The answer\\nwas, \"Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.  She had rather\\nplay.  She is never tired of playing.\"  Once, too, he spoke to her.\\nShe had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and he had sat\\ndown to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss\\nMusgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally she returned to that part of the\\nroom; he saw her, and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness--\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she\\nimmediately drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced\\nto sit down again.\\n\\nAnne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.  His cold\\npoliteness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay as long as\\nhe liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral's fraternal\\nkindness as of his wife's.  He had intended, on first arriving, to\\nproceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in\\nthat country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this\\noff.  There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of\\neverything most bewitching in his reception there; the old were so\\nhospitable, the young so agreeable, that he could not but resolve to\\nremain where he was, and take all the charms and perfections of\\nEdward's wife upon credit a little longer.\\n\\nIt was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.  The Musgroves could\\nhardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly in the\\nmorning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs\\nCroft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in\\ntheir new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about\\nin a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,\\nlately added to their establishment.\\n\\nHitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the\\nMusgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying, warm admiration\\neverywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established,\\nwhen a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal\\ndisturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way.\\n\\nCharles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,\\npleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a\\nconsiderable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's\\nintroduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in the\\nneighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father's\\nhouse, only two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home had\\nleft his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,\\nand of seeing Captain Wentworth.\\n\\nMrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money, but\\ntheir marriages had made a material difference in their degree of\\nconsequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own, but it was\\ninsignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while the Musgroves were\\nin the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would,\\nfrom their parents' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living,\\nand their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at\\nall, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course\\nexcepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was\\nvery superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.\\n\\nThe two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no\\npride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a\\nconsciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them\\npleased to improve their cousins.  Charles's attentions to Henrietta\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.\\n\"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,\"--\\nand Henrietta did seem to like him.\\n\\nHenrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; but\\nfrom that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.\\n\\nWhich of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet\\nquite doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reached.  Henrietta was\\nperhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits; and she knew not\\nnow, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most\\nlikely to attract him.\\n\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entire\\nconfidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all the\\nyoung men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its\\nchance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark\\nabout them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage:\\nthe young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and\\nCaptain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss\\nMusgroves' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when\\nAnne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as to\\nwhich was the one liked best.  Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for\\nHenrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be\\nextremely delightful.\\n\\nCharles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what he\\nhad once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he had\\nnot made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.  Here was a\\nfortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might\\nbe done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as\\nlikely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.  Oh! it\\nwould be a capital match for either of his sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word it would,\" replied Mary.  \"Dear me!  If he should rise to\\nany very great honours!  If he should ever be made a baronet!  'Lady\\nWentworth' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing, indeed, for\\nHenrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not\\ndislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!  It would be but a new\\ncreation, however, and I never think much of your new creations.\"\\n\\nIt suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very\\naccount of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished to see put an\\nend to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought\\nit would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between\\nthe families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.\\n\\n\"You know,\" said she, \"I cannot think him at all a fit match for\\nHenrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,\\nshe has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\nto the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to\\nthose who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles\\nHayter?  Nothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss\\nMusgrove of Uppercross.\"\\n\\nHer husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having\\na regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he saw\\nthings as an eldest son himself.\\n\\n\"Now you are talking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer.  \"It\\nwould not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair\\nchance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in\\nthe course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he\\nis the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty\\nproperty.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and\\nfifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best\\nland in the country.  I grant you, that any of them but Charles would\\nbe a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he\\nis the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured,\\ngood sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he\\nwill make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different\\nsort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible\\nman--good, freehold property.  No, no; Henrietta might do worse than\\nmarry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get Captain\\nWentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.\"\\n\\n\"Charles may say what he pleases,\" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he\\nwas out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry\\nCharles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; and\\ntherefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon\\nput him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he\\nhas.  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.  I wish\\nyou had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to Captain Wentworth's\\nliking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he\\ncertainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.  But Charles is so\\npositive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might\\nhave decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did,\\nunless you had been determined to give it against me.\"\\n\\nA dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things\\nshould have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home, under the\\nmixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return of indisposition\\nin little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth;\\nbut an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the\\nadvantages of a quiet evening.\\n\\nAs to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence that\\nhe should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the\\nhappiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour, than that he\\nshould prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.  Either of\\nthem would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humoured\\nwife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy which must be\\npained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a\\nheart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if\\nHenrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the\\nalteration could not be understood too soon.\\n\\nCharles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his\\ncousin's behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly\\nestranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and\\nleave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross:  but there\\nwas such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain\\nWentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause.  He had been absent\\nonly two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her interested, even\\nto the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his\\npresent curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then\\nseemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who\\nfor more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties\\nof his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should\\nbe quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as\\ngood as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of\\nit.  The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of\\ngoing six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better\\ncuracy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr\\nShirley's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get\\nthrough without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to\\nLouisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he came\\nback, alas!  the zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not\\nlisten at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held\\nwith Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking out for Captain\\nWentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to\\ngive, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude\\nof the negotiation.\\n\\n\"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;\\nI always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short, you\\nknow, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.\\nIs he coming, Louisa?\"\\n\\nOne morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anne\\nhad not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at\\nthe Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles,\\nwho was lying on the sofa.\\n\\nThe surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprived\\nhis manners of their usual composure:  he started, and could only say,\\n\"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me I\\nshould find them here,\" before he walked to the window to recollect\\nhimself, and feel how he ought to behave.\\n\\n\"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few\\nmoments, I dare say,\" had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that\\nwas natural; and if the child had not called her to come and do\\nsomething for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment,\\nand released Captain Wentworth as well as herself.\\n\\nHe continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, \"I\\nhope the little boy is better,\" was silent.\\n\\nShe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy\\nher patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her very\\ngreat satisfaction, she heard some other person crossing the little\\nvestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head, to see the master of the\\nhouse; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters\\neasy--Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight\\nof Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of\\nAnne.\\n\\nShe only attempted to say, \"How do you do?  Will you not sit down?  The\\nothers will be here presently.\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently not\\nill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to\\nhis attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the\\nnewspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.\\n\\nAnother minute brought another addition.  The younger boy, a remarkable\\nstout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for\\nhim by some one without, made his determined appearance among them, and\\nwent straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his\\nclaim to anything good that might be giving away.\\n\\nThere being nothing to eat, he could only have some play; and as his\\naunt would not let him tease his sick brother, he began to fasten\\nhimself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she was\\nabout Charles, she could not shake him off.  She spoke to him, ordered,\\nentreated, and insisted in vain.  Once she did contrive to push him\\naway, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back\\nagain directly.\\n\\n\"Walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  You are extremely\\ntroublesome.  I am very angry with you.\"\\n\\n\"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?  Do\\nnot you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to cousin\\nCharles.\"\\n\\nBut not a bit did Walter stir.\\n\\nIn another moment, however, she found herself in the state of being\\nreleased from him; some one was taking him from her, though he had bent\\ndown her head so much, that his little sturdy hands were unfastened\\nfrom around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew\\nthat Captain Wentworth had done it.\\n\\nHer sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.  She\\ncould not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,\\nwith most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward to her\\nrelief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the little\\nparticulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on her\\nby the noise he was studiously making with the child, that he meant to\\navoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought to testify that her\\nconversation was the last of his wants, produced such a confusion of\\nvarying, but very painful agitation, as she could not recover from,\\ntill enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make\\nover her little patient to their cares, and leave the room.  She could\\nnot stay.  It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and\\njealousies of the four--they were now altogether; but she could stay\\nfor none of it.  It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well\\ninclined towards Captain Wentworth.  She had a strong impression of his\\nhaving said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's\\ninterference, \"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to\\nteaze your aunt;\" and could comprehend his regretting that Captain\\nWentworth should do what he ought to have done himself.  But neither\\nCharles Hayter's feelings, nor anybody's feelings, could interest her,\\ntill she had a little better arranged her own.  She was ashamed of\\nherself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a\\ntrifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude\\nand reflection to recover her.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\n\\nOther opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.\\nAnne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\nto have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife; for\\nwhile she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite, she could not\\nbut think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory and\\nexperience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.  They\\nwere more in love with him; yet there it was not love.  It was a little\\nfever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love with\\nsome.  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted, and yet Henrietta\\nhad sometimes the air of being divided between them.  Anne longed for\\nthe power of representing to them all what they were about, and of\\npointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.  She\\ndid not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction to her\\nto believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was\\noccasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his manner.\\nHe had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims of\\nCharles Hayter.  He was only wrong in accepting the attentions (for\\naccepting must be the word) of two young women at once.\\n\\nAfter a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the\\nfield.  Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross; a\\nmost decided change.  He had even refused one regular invitation to\\ndinner; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some\\nlarge books before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be\\nright, and talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.\\nIt was Mary's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\nfrom Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence of\\nseeing him to-morrow.  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was\\nwise.\\n\\nOne morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth\\nbeing gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage were\\nsitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters\\nfrom the Mansion-house.\\n\\nIt was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came through\\nthe little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, that\\nthey were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded Mary could\\nnot like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied, with some\\njealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"Oh, yes, I should like\\nto join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;\" Anne felt\\npersuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what\\nthey did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the\\nfamily habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be\\ncommunicated, and everything being to be done together, however\\nundesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going, but\\nin vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss\\nMusgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as\\nshe might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening the\\ninterference in any plan of their own.\\n\\n\"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long\\nwalk,\" said Mary, as she went up stairs.  \"Everybody is always\\nsupposing that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been\\npleased, if we had refused to join them.  When people come in this\\nmanner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\"\\n\\nJust as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken\\nout a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.\\nTheir time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready\\nfor this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne have\\nforeseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but, from some\\nfeelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was too\\nlate to retract, and the whole six set forward together in the\\ndirection chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the\\nwalk as under their guidance.\\n\\nAnne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the\\nnarrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keep\\nwith her brother and sister.  Her pleasure in the walk must arise from\\nthe exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year\\nupon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to\\nherself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of\\nautumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind\\nof taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet,\\nworthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of\\nfeeling.  She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like\\nmusings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach\\nof Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,\\nshe should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.\\nIt was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate\\nfooting, might fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with\\nHenrietta.  Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her\\nsister.  This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one\\nspeech of Louisa's which struck her.  After one of the many praises of\\nthe day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth\\nadded:--\\n\\n\"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to\\ntake a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of\\nthese hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.  I\\nwonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen very\\noften, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she would as\\nlieve be tossed out as not.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! You make the most of it, I know,\" cried Louisa, \"but if it were\\nreally so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,\\nas she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should\\never separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven\\nsafely by anybody else.\"\\n\\nIt was spoken with enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"Had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"I honour you!\" And there\\nwas silence between them for a little while.\\n\\nAnne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet\\nscenes of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining\\nhappiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone\\ntogether, blessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as they\\nstruck by order into another path, \"Is not this one of the ways to\\nWinthrop?\" But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.\\n\\nWinthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes to be\\nmet with, strolling about near home--was their destination; and after\\nanother half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where the\\nploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting\\nthe sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning to have spring again,\\nthey gained the summit of the most considerable hill, which parted\\nUppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view of the latter,\\nat the foot of the hill on the other side.\\n\\nWinthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them;\\nan indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and\\nbuildings of a farm-yard.\\n\\nMary exclaimed, \"Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!\\nWell now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.\"\\n\\nHenrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles walking\\nalong any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready to do as Mary\\nwished; but \"No!\" said Charles Musgrove, and \"No, no!\" cried Louisa\\nmore eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be arguing the\\nmatter warmly.\\n\\nCharles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\nof calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,\\nthough more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.  But this\\nwas one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength; and when\\nhe recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at\\nWinthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered, \"Oh! no,\\nindeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any\\nsitting down could do her good;\" and, in short, her look and manner\\ndeclared, that go she would not.\\n\\nAfter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,\\nit was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he and\\nHenrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt and\\ncousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the\\nhill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as she\\nwent a little way with them, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta,\\nMary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her, and saying\\nto Captain Wentworth--\\n\\n\"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you, I\\nhave never been in the house above twice in my life.\"\\n\\nShe received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne\\nperfectly knew the meaning of.\\n\\nThe brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot: Louisa\\nreturned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step\\nof a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood\\nabout her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away, to try for a\\ngleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row, and they were gone by\\ndegrees quite out of sight and sound, Mary was happy no longer; she\\nquarrelled with her own seat, was sure Louisa had got a much better\\nsomewhere, and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a\\nbetter also.  She turned through the same gate, but could not see them.\\nAnne found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the\\nhedge-row, in which she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot\\nor other.  Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was\\nsure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on\\ntill she overtook her.\\n\\nAnne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon\\nheard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if\\nmaking their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the\\ncentre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa's voice was the\\nfirst distinguished.  She seemed to be in the middle of some eager\\nspeech.  What Anne first heard was--\\n\\n\"And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightened\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from\\ndoing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,\\nby the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may\\nsay?  No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have\\nmade up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have\\nmade up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near\\ngiving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\"\\n\\n\"She would have turned back then, but for you?\"\\n\\n\"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it.\"\\n\\n\"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints\\nyou gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last\\ntime I was in company with him,  I need not affect to have no\\ncomprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than a mere dutiful\\nmorning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him, and her\\ntoo, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in\\ncircumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if she have not\\nresolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this.\\nYour sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of\\ndecision and firmness, I see.  If you value her conduct or happiness,\\ninfuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, no\\ndoubt, you have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too\\nyielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be\\ndepended on.  You are never sure of a good impression being durable;\\neverybody may sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here is\\na nut,\" said he, catching one down from an upper bough, \"to exemplify:\\na beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, has\\noutlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not a weak spot\\nanywhere.  This nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity, \"while so\\nmany of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still\\nin possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed\\ncapable of.\"  Then returning to his former earnest tone--\"My first\\nwish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.  If\\nLouisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind.\"\\n\\nHe had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if\\nLouisa could have readily answered such a speech:  words of such\\ninterest, spoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what\\nLouisa was feeling.  For herself, she feared to move, lest she should\\nbe seen.  While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected\\nher, and they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,\\nhowever, Louisa spoke again.\\n\\n\"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she; \"but she does\\nsometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride--the Elliot\\npride.  She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.  We do so\\nwish that Charles had married Anne instead.  I suppose you know he\\nwanted to marry Anne?\"\\n\\nAfter a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--\\n\\n\"Do you mean that she refused him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes; certainly.\"\\n\\n\"When did that happen?\"\\n\\n\"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;\\nbut I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had\\naccepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better; and\\npapa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell's\\ndoing, that she did not.  They think Charles might not be learned and\\nbookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, she\\npersuaded Anne to refuse him.\"\\n\\nThe sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.  Her own\\nemotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from, before\\nshe could move.  The listener's proverbial fate was not absolutely\\nhers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard a great deal\\nof very painful import.  She saw how her own character was considered\\nby Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling\\nand curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme\\nagitation.\\n\\nAs soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found, and walked\\nback with her to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort\\nin their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once\\nmore in motion together.  Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence\\nwhich only numbers could give.\\n\\nCharles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,\\nCharles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne could not\\nattempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to\\nperfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing on the\\ngentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they were now\\nvery glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.  Henrietta\\nlooked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--Charles Hayter\\nexceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other almost from the\\nfirst instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.\\n\\nEverything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could\\nbe plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where they\\nwere not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two.  In\\na long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they\\nwere thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of\\nthe three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Anne\\nnecessarily belonged.  She joined Charles and Mary, and was tired\\nenough to be very glad of Charles's other arm; but Charles, though in\\nvery good humour with her, was out of temper with his wife.  Mary had\\nshewn herself disobliging to him, and was now to reap the consequence,\\nwhich consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut\\noff the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when\\nMary began to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according\\nto custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded\\non the other, he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which\\nhe had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at\\nall.\\n\\nThis long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of\\nit was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time\\nheard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig.  He\\nand his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.\\nUpon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, they\\nkindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; it\\nwould save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.\\nThe invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves\\nwere not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked\\nbefore any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could\\nnot endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.\\n\\nThe walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an\\nopposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,\\nwhen Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\nto his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.\\n\\n\"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,\" cried Mrs Croft.  \"Do let us\\nhave the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room for\\nthree, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might sit\\nfour.  You must, indeed, you must.\"\\n\\nAnne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to\\ndecline, she was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral's kind urgency\\ncame in support of his wife's; they would not be refused; they\\ncompressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a\\ncorner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her,\\nand quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.\\n\\nYes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he had\\nplaced her there, that his will and his hands had done it, that she\\nowed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution to give\\nher rest.  She was very much affected by the view of his disposition\\ntowards her, which all these things made apparent.  This little\\ncircumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.  She\\nunderstood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not be\\nunfeeling.  Though condemning her for the past, and considering it with\\nhigh and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her, and\\nthough becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder of former\\nsentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship;\\nit was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart, which she could not\\ncontemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that\\nshe knew not which prevailed.\\n\\nHer answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at\\nfirst unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way along the\\nrough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.  She then\\nfound them talking of \"Frederick.\"\\n\\n\"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,\"\\nsaid the Admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  He has been running\\nafter them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.\\nAy, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have settled\\nit long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make long\\ncourtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear, between the\\nfirst time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our\\nlodgings at North Yarmouth?\"\\n\\n\"We had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied Mrs Croft,\\npleasantly; \"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an\\nunderstanding, she would never be persuaded that we could be happy\\ntogether.  I had known you by character, however, long before.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we\\nto wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.\\nI wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home\\none of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always be\\ncompany for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly\\nknow one from the other.\"\\n\\n\"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said Mrs Croft, in a\\ntone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers\\nmight not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother; \"and\\na very respectable family.  One could not be connected with better\\npeople.  My dear Admiral, that post!  we shall certainly take that\\npost.\"\\n\\nBut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\npassed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her\\nhand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart; and\\nAnne, with some amusement at their style of driving, which she imagined\\nno bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs, found\\nherself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\n\\nThe time now approached for Lady Russell's return:  the day was even\\nfixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was\\nresettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and\\nbeginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.\\n\\nIt would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within\\nhalf a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, and\\nthere must be intercourse between the two families.  This was against\\nher; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross,\\nthat in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him\\nbehind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed\\nshe must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as\\ncertainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary\\nfor Lady Russell.\\n\\nShe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain\\nWentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed former meetings which\\nwould be brought too painfully before her; but she was yet more anxious\\nfor the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting\\nanywhere.  They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintance\\nnow could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, she\\nmight think that he had too much self-possession, and she too little.\\n\\nThese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal\\nfrom Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed quite long\\nenough.  Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some\\nsweetness to the memory of her two months' visit there, but he was\\ngaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.\\n\\nThe conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way which\\nshe had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen and\\nunheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.\\n\\nA letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at\\nlast, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled with\\nhis family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite\\nunknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville had\\nnever been in good health since a severe wound which he received two\\nyears before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him had determined\\nhim to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there for four-and-twenty\\nhours.  His acquittal was complete, his friendship warmly honoured, a\\nlively interest excited for his friend, and his description of the fine\\ncountry about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that an\\nearnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thither\\nwas the consequence.\\n\\nThe young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talked\\nof going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from\\nUppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in\\nshort, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the\\nresolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked, being\\nnow armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way, bore down\\nall the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer;\\nand to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa,\\nand Captain Wentworth.\\n\\nThe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at\\nnight; but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not\\nconsent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the\\nmiddle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,\\nafter deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for\\ngoing and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,\\nand not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.  This was felt\\nto be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great\\nHouse at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach\\ncontaining the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which he drove\\nCaptain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and\\nentering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it was\\nvery evident they would not have more than time for looking about them,\\nbefore the light and warmth of the day were gone.\\n\\nAfter securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the\\ninns, the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\ndown to the sea.  They were come too late in the year for any amusement\\nor variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.  The rooms were\\nshut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the\\nresidents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings\\nthemselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street\\nalmost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round\\nthe pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing\\nmachines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new\\nimprovements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to\\nthe east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very\\nstrange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate\\nenvirons of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.  The scenes in\\nits neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive\\nsweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by\\ndark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the\\nhappiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in\\nunwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of\\nUp Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic\\nrocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant\\ngrowth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the\\nfirst partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a\\nstate, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may\\nmore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of\\nWight:  these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the\\nworth of Lyme understood.\\n\\nThe party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and\\nmelancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves\\non the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze on a\\nfirst return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,\\nproceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself and on\\nCaptain Wentworth's account:  for in a small house, near the foot of an\\nold pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.  Captain\\nWentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on, and he\\nwas to join them on the Cobb.\\n\\nThey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even\\nLouisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,\\nwhen they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all well\\nknown already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville, and a\\nCaptain Benwick, who was staying with them.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;\\nand the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him, on his return\\nfrom Lyme before, his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and\\nan officer, whom he had always valued highly, which must have stamped\\nhim well in the esteem of every listener, had been followed by a little\\nhistory of his private life, which rendered him perfectly interesting\\nin the eyes of all the ladies.  He had been engaged to Captain\\nHarville's sister, and was now mourning her loss.  They had been a year\\nor two waiting for fortune and promotion.  Fortune came, his\\nprize-money as lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at last;\\nbut Fanny Harville did not live to know it.  She had died the preceding\\nsummer while he was at sea.  Captain Wentworth believed it impossible\\nfor man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to\\nFanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful\\nchange.  He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer\\nheavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring\\nmanners, and a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits.  To\\nfinish the interest of the story, the friendship between him and the\\nHarvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all\\ntheir views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them\\nentirely.  Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a\\nyear; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him to\\na residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the\\ncountry, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly\\nadapted to Captain Benwick's state of mind.  The sympathy and good-will\\nexcited towards Captain Benwick was very great.\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward to meet the\\nparty, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have.  I\\ncannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.  He is younger than\\nI am; younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a man.  He will\\nrally again, and be happy with another.\"\\n\\nThey all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall, dark\\nman, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and from\\nstrong features and want of health, looking much older than Captain\\nWentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three,\\nand, compared with either of them, a little man.  He had a pleasing\\nface and a melancholy air, just as he ought to have, and drew back from\\nconversation.\\n\\nCaptain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,\\nwas a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.  Mrs Harville,\\na degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however, to have the\\nsame good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their\\ndesire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because\\nthe friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their\\nentreaties for their all promising to dine with them.  The dinner,\\nalready ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, accepted\\nas a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should\\nhave brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thing\\nof course that they should dine with them.\\n\\nThere was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and such\\na bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlike\\nthe usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formality\\nand display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by\\nan increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.  \"These would\\nhave been all my friends,\" was her thought; and she had to struggle\\nagainst a great tendency to lowness.\\n\\nOn quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had a moment's\\nastonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost in the\\npleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious\\ncontrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville, to turn the\\nactual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies of\\nlodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors against the\\nwinter storms to be expected.  The varieties in the fitting-up of the\\nrooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in the\\ncommon indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a\\nrare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious\\nand valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had\\nvisited, were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with\\nhis profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence\\non his habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it\\npresented, made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.\\n\\nCaptain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived excellent\\naccommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable\\ncollection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick.  His\\nlameness prevented him from taking much exercise; but a mind of\\nusefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment\\nwithin.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered, he glued; he made toys\\nfor the children; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with\\nimprovements; and if everything else was done, sat down to his large\\nfishing-net at one corner of the room.\\n\\nAnne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the\\nhouse; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking, burst forth into\\nraptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; their\\nfriendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness;\\nprotesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and\\nwarmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how to\\nlive, and they only deserved to be respected and loved.\\n\\nThey went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme answered\\nalready, that nothing was found amiss; though its being \"so entirely\\nout of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of Lyme,\" and the \"no\\nexpectation of company,\" had brought many apologies from the heads of\\nthe inn.\\n\\nAnne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being\\nin Captain Wentworth's company than she had at first imagined could\\never be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now, and the\\ninterchange of the common civilities attending on it (they never got\\nbeyond), was become a mere nothing.\\n\\nThe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,\\nbut Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and he\\ncame, bringing his friend also, which was more than had been expected,\\nit having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of\\nbeing oppressed by the presence of so many strangers.  He ventured\\namong them again, however, though his spirits certainly did not seem\\nfit for the mirth of the party in general.\\n\\nWhile Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the\\nroom, and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance\\nto occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne's lot to be placed\\nrather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of her\\nnature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.  He was shy, and\\ndisposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of her countenance,\\nand gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect; and Anne was well\\nrepaid the first trouble of exertion.  He was evidently a young man of\\nconsiderable taste in reading, though principally in poetry; and\\nbesides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening's\\nindulgence in the discussion of subjects, which his usual companions\\nhad probably no concern in, she had the hope of being of real use to\\nhim in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling\\nagainst affliction, which had naturally grown out of their\\nconversation.  For, though shy, he did not seem reserved; it had rather\\nthe appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; and\\nhaving talked of poetry, the richness of the present age, and gone\\nthrough a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets,\\ntrying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be\\npreferred, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and\\nmoreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, he showed himself so\\nintimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, and\\nall the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; he\\nrepeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a\\nbroken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness, and looked so\\nentirely as if he meant to be understood, that she ventured to hope he\\ndid not always read only poetry, and to say, that she thought it was\\nthe misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who\\nenjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone could\\nestimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but\\nsparingly.\\n\\nHis looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion to his\\nsituation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself the\\nright of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend a larger\\nallowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested to\\nparticularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists, such\\ncollections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters of worth\\nand suffering, as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse\\nand fortify the mind by the highest precepts, and the strongest\\nexamples of moral and religious endurances.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for the\\ninterest implied; and though with a shake of the head, and sighs which\\ndeclared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like\\nhis, noted down the names of those she recommended, and promised to\\nprocure and read them.\\n\\nWhen the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea of\\nher coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\nwhom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing, on more\\nserious reflection, that, like many other great moralists and\\npreachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\nwould ill bear examination.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\n\\nAnne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party the\\nnext morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.  They\\nwent to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide, which a fine\\nsouth-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so\\nflat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning; gloried in the sea;\\nsympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze--and were\\nsilent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--\\n\\n\"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the\\nsea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been of\\nthe greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness, last spring\\ntwelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month,\\ndid him more good than all the medicine he took; and, that being by the\\nsea, always makes him feel young again.  Now, I cannot help thinking it\\na pity that he does not live entirely by the sea.  I do think he had\\nbetter leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anne?\\nDo not you agree with me, that it is the best thing he could do, both\\nfor himself and Mrs Shirley?  She has cousins here, you know, and many\\nacquaintance, which would make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she\\nwould be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance\\nat hand, in case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think it\\nquite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley,\\nwho have been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days\\nin a place like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut\\nout from all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him.  I\\nreally think they ought.  And, as to procuring a dispensation, there\\ncould be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.  My\\nonly doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.\\nHe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous I\\nmust say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?  Do not\\nyou think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman\\nsacrifices his health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well\\nperformed by another person?  And at Lyme too, only seventeen miles\\noff, he would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was\\nanything to complain of.\"\\n\\nAnne smiled more than once to herself during this speech, and entered\\ninto the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of\\na young lady as of a young man, though here it was good of a lower\\nstandard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?  She said\\nall that was reasonable and proper on the business; felt the claims of\\nDr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very desirable it was that\\nhe should have some active, respectable young man, as a resident\\ncurate, and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such\\nresident curate's being married.\\n\\n\"I wish,\" said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion, \"I wish\\nLady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley.  I\\nhave always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence\\nwith everybody!  I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to\\nanything!  I am afraid of her, as I have told you before, quite afraid\\nof her, because she is so very clever; but I respect her amazingly, and\\nwish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross.\"\\n\\nAnne was amused by Henrietta's manner of being grateful, and amused\\nalso that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta's\\nviews should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the\\nMusgrove family; she had only time, however, for a general answer, and\\na wish that such another woman were at Uppercross, before all subjects\\nsuddenly ceased, on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards\\nthem.  They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be\\nready; but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had\\nsomething to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her\\ninto the town.  They were all at her disposal.\\n\\nWhen they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a\\ngentleman, at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew\\nback, and stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed him; and\\nas they passed, Anne's face caught his eye, and he looked at her with a\\ndegree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.\\nShe was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty\\nfeatures, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine\\nwind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of\\neye which it had also produced.  It was evident that the gentleman,\\n(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.  Captain\\nWentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his\\nnoticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of\\nbrightness, which seemed to say, \"That man is struck with you, and even\\nI, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.\"\\n\\nAfter attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about a\\nlittle longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing\\nafterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had\\nnearly run against the very same gentleman, as he came out of an\\nadjoining apartment.  She had before conjectured him to be a stranger\\nlike themselves, and determined that a well-looking groom, who was\\nstrolling about near the two inns as they came back, should be his\\nservant.  Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.  It\\nwas now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves; and this\\nsecond meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman's\\nlooks, that he thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness and\\npropriety of his apologies, that he was a man of exceedingly good\\nmanners.  He seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had an\\nagreeable person.  Anne felt that she should like to know who he was.\\n\\nThey had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage, (almost\\nthe first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party to\\nthe window.  It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle, but only coming\\nround from the stable-yard to the front door; somebody must be going\\naway.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.\\n\\nThe word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare\\nit with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne's curiosity, and\\nthe whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner of the\\ncurricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and\\ncivilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at\\nAnne, \"it is the very man we passed.\"\\n\\nThe Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him as\\nfar up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.\\nThe waiter came into the room soon afterwards.\\n\\n\"Pray,\" said Captain Wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last\\nnight from Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you\\nwere at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath and\\nLondon.\"\\n\\n\"Elliot!\"  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the\\nname, before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity\\nof a waiter.\\n\\n\"Bless me!\" cried Mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr\\nElliot, it must, indeed!  Charles, Anne, must not it?  In mourning, you\\nsee, just as our Mr Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary!  In the\\nvery same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?  my\\nfather's next heir?  Pray sir,\" turning to the waiter, \"did not you\\nhear, did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch\\nfamily?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said his\\nmaster was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\"\\n\\n\"There! you see!\" cried Mary in an ecstasy, \"just as I said!  Heir to\\nSir Walter Elliot!  I was sure that would come out, if it was so.\\nDepend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants take care to\\npublish, wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive how extraordinary!\\nI wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had been aware in time, who\\nit was, that he might have been introduced to us.  What a pity that we\\nshould not have been introduced to each other!  Do you think he had the\\nElliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him, I was looking at the\\nhorses; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance, I\\nwonder the arms did not strike me!  Oh! the great-coat was hanging over\\nthe panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should\\nhave observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been in\\nmourning, one should have known him by the livery.\"\\n\\n\"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\" said\\nCaptain Wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement of\\nProvidence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\"\\n\\nWhen she could command Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried to convince\\nher that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years, been on\\nsuch terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all\\ndesirable.\\n\\nAt the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself to\\nhave seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was\\nundoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.  She would not,\\nupon any account, mention her having met with him the second time;\\nluckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in\\ntheir earlier walk, but she would have felt quite ill-used by Anne's\\nhaving actually run against him in the passage, and received his very\\npolite excuses, while she had never been near him at all; no, that\\ncousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Mary, \"you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot, the\\nnext time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly ought to hear\\nof it; do mention all about him.\"\\n\\nAnne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which she\\nconsidered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated, but as what\\nought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given her father,\\nmany years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share in it she\\nsuspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation in both\\nwas beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil of\\nkeeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell\\non Anne.\\n\\nBreakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain and\\nMrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed to take\\ntheir last walk about Lyme.  They ought to be setting off for\\nUppercross by one, and in the meanwhile were to be all together, and\\nout of doors as long as they could.\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all\\nfairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening did not\\ndisincline him to seek her again; and they walked together some time,\\ntalking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron, and still as unable as\\nbefore, and as unable as any other two readers, to think exactly alike\\nof the merits of either, till something occasioned an almost general\\nchange amongst their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, she had\\nCaptain Harville by her side.\\n\\n\"Miss Elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish he could have such\\ncompany oftener.  It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is;\\nbut what can we do?  We cannot part.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"that I can easily believe to be impossible; but in\\ntime, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction, and\\nyou must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be called\\na young mourner--only last summer, I understand.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only June.\"\\n\\n\"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\"\\n\\n\"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,\\njust made into the Grappler.  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of\\nhim; he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for\\nPortsmouth.  There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it?\\nnot I.  I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could\\ndo it, but that good fellow\" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  \"The\\nLaconia had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her being\\nsent to sea again.  He stood his chance for the rest; wrote up for\\nleave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night and\\nday till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant,\\nand never left the poor fellow for a week.  That's what he did, and\\nnobody else could have saved poor James.  You may think, Miss Elliot,\\nwhether he is dear to us!\"\\n\\nAnne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed able to\\nbear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject, and when he\\nspoke again, it was of something totally different.\\n\\nMrs Harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the\\ndirection of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they\\nwould accompany them to their door, and then return and set off\\nthemselves.  By all their calculations there was just time for this;\\nbut as they drew near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk\\nalong it once more, all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so\\ndetermined, that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,\\nwould be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking, and\\nall the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be\\nimagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door,\\nand still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them\\nto the last, proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb.\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.  Lord Byron's \"dark\\nblue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by their present\\nview, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention\\nwas possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.\\n\\nThere was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant\\nfor the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, and\\nall were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,\\nexcepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.\\nIn all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles; the\\nsensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement for her\\nfeet, made him less willing upon the present occasion; he did it,\\nhowever.  She was safely down, and instantly, to show her enjoyment,\\nran up the steps to be jumped down again.  He advised her against it,\\nthought the jar too great; but no, he reasoned and talked in vain, she\\nsmiled and said, \"I am determined I will:\" he put out his hands; she\\nwas too precipitate by half a second, she fell on the pavement on the\\nLower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!  There was no wound, no blood,\\nno visible bruise; but her eyes were closed, she breathed not, her face\\nwas like death.  The horror of the moment to all who stood around!\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of\\nsilence.  \"She is dead! she is dead!\" screamed Mary, catching hold of\\nher husband, and contributing with his own horror to make him\\nimmoveable; and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the\\nconviction, lost her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps,\\nbut for Captain Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between\\nthem.\\n\\n\"Is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which burst from\\nCaptain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if all his own strength\\nwere gone.\\n\\n\"Go to him, go to him,\" cried Anne, \"for heaven's sake go to him.  I\\ncan support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands, rub\\nher temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"\\n\\nCaptain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment, disengaging\\nhimself from his wife, they were both with him; and Louisa was raised\\nup and supported more firmly between them, and everything was done that\\nAnne had prompted, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggering\\nagainst the wall for his support, exclaimed in the bitterest agony--\\n\\n\"Oh God! her father and mother!\"\\n\\n\"A surgeon!\" said Anne.\\n\\nHe caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--\\n\"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away, when Anne\\neagerly suggested--\\n\\n\"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?  He knows\\nwhere a surgeon is to be found.\"\\n\\nEvery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in a\\nmoment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had resigned\\nthe poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother's care, and was\\noff for the town with the utmost rapidity.\\n\\nAs to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said which\\nof the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most: Captain\\nWentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate brother,\\nhung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes from\\none sister, to see the other in a state as insensible, or to witness\\nthe hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him for help which he\\ncould not give.\\n\\nAnne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought, which\\ninstinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals, to suggest\\ncomfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles, to\\nassuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her\\nfor directions.\\n\\n\"Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?  What, in\\nheaven's name, is to be done next?\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her.\\n\\n\"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure: carry her\\ngently to the inn.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively\\ncollected, and eager to be doing something.  \"I will carry her myself.\\nMusgrove, take care of the others.\"\\n\\nBy this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\nand boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them, to be\\nuseful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady,\\nnay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine as the first\\nreport.  To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrietta was\\nconsigned, for, though partially revived, she was quite helpless; and\\nin this manner, Anne walking by her side, and Charles attending to his\\nwife, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, the\\nground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, they\\nhad passed along.\\n\\nThey were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.  Captain\\nBenwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance which\\nshowed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,\\ninformed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.  Shocked as\\nCaptain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could be\\ninstantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what was\\nto be done.  She must be taken to their house; all must go to their\\nhouse; and await the surgeon's arrival there.  They would not listen to\\nscruples:  he was obeyed; they were all beneath his roof; and while\\nLouisa, under Mrs Harville's direction, was conveyed up stairs, and\\ngiven possession of her own bed, assistance, cordials, restoratives\\nwere supplied by her husband to all who needed them.\\n\\nLouisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again, without\\napparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life, however, of\\nservice to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly incapable of\\nbeing in the same room with Louisa, was kept, by the agitation of hope\\nand fear, from a return of her own insensibility.  Mary, too, was\\ngrowing calmer.\\n\\nThe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.  They\\nwere sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.  The\\nhead had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries\\nrecovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.\\n\\nThat he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say a\\nfew hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; and\\nthe ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after a\\nfew fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered, may\\nbe conceived.\\n\\nThe tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered by Captain\\nWentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sight\\nof him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folded\\narms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of\\nhis soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.\\n\\nLouisa's limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.\\n\\nIt now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be\\ndone, as to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to\\neach other and consult.  That Louisa must remain where she was, however\\ndistressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such\\ntrouble, did not admit a doubt.  Her removal was impossible.  The\\nHarvilles silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all\\ngratitude.  They had looked forward and arranged everything before the\\nothers began to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to\\nthem, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.  They\\nwere only concerned that the house could accommodate no more; and yet\\nperhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid's room, or swinging\\na cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not finding room\\nfor two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay; though,\\nwith regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be the\\nleast uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville's care entirely.  Mrs\\nHarville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid, who had\\nlived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere, was just such\\nanother.  Between these two, she could want no possible attendance by\\nday or night.  And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of\\nfeeling irresistible.\\n\\nCharles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in\\nconsultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange of\\nperplexity and terror.  \"Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going\\nto Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr\\nand Mrs Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone\\nsince they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in\\ntolerable time.\" At first, they were capable of nothing more to the\\npurpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,\\nexerting himself, said--\\n\\n\"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.  Every\\nminute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross\\ninstantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go.\"\\n\\nCharles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.  He\\nwould be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor\\nwould.  So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the\\nsame.  She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The\\nusefulness of her staying!  She who had not been able to remain in\\nLouisa's room, or to look at her, without sufferings which made her\\nworse than helpless!  She was forced to acknowledge that she could do\\nno good, yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the\\nthought of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented, she\\nwas anxious to be at home.\\n\\nThe plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly down from\\nLouisa's room, could not but hear what followed, for the parlour door\\nwas open.\\n\\n\"Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth, \"that you\\nstay, and that I take care of your sister home.  But as to the rest, as\\nto the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be\\nonly one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to\\nher children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as\\nAnne.\"\\n\\nShe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so\\nspoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said, and she then\\nappeared.\\n\\n\"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which\\nseemed almost restoring the past.  She coloured deeply, and he\\nrecollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself most\\nwilling, ready, happy to remain.  \"It was what she had been thinking\\nof, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor in Louisa's\\nroom would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville would but think so.\"\\n\\nOne thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather\\ndesirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\nshare of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take\\nthem back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and Captain\\nWentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be much\\nbetter for him to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr Musgrove's\\ncarriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when there\\nwould be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa's night.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was made\\nknown to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.  She was\\nso wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice in being\\nexpected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa,\\nwhile she was her sister, and had the best right to stay in Henrietta's\\nstead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?  And to go home\\nwithout Charles, too, without her husband!  No, it was too unkind.  And\\nin short, she said more than her husband could long withstand, and as\\nnone of the others could oppose when he gave way, there was no help for\\nit; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable.\\n\\nAnne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and\\nill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off for the\\ntown, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick attending\\nto her.  She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along, to\\nthe little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in\\nthe morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta's schemes for Dr\\nShirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had first seen Mr Elliot;\\na moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa, or\\nthose who were wrapt up in her welfare.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and, united as\\nthey all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt an increasing\\ndegree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even in thinking that\\nit might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in\\nwaiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the\\nstreet; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of\\none sister for the other, the change in his countenance, the\\nastonishment, the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles\\nwas listened to, made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at\\nleast convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to\\nLouisa.\\n\\nShe endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating the\\nfeelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have attended on\\nLouisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his sake; and\\nshe hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink\\nunnecessarily from the office of a friend.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,\\nand placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these\\ncircumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted\\nLyme.  How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their\\nmanners; what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not\\nforesee.  It was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted to\\nHenrietta; always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always\\nwith the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  In\\ngeneral, his voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henrietta\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only, when she had\\nbeen grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb,\\nbitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of, he burst forth, as\\nif wholly overcome--\\n\\n\"Don't talk of it, don't talk of it,\" he cried.  \"Oh God! that I had\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!  But\\nso eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!\"\\n\\nAnne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the\\njustness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and\\nadvantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him\\nthat, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its\\nproportions and limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to\\nfeel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of\\nhappiness as a very resolute character.\\n\\nThey got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and\\nthe same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by some dread\\nof the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long as on the day\\nbefore.  It was growing quite dusk, however, before they were in the\\nneighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been total silence among\\nthem for some time, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, with a shawl\\nover her face, giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep;\\nwhen, as they were going up their last hill, Anne found herself all at\\nonce addressed by Captain Wentworth.  In a low, cautious voice, he\\nsaid:--\\n\\n\"I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not appear at\\nfirst.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether you had\\nnot better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in and break it\\nto Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?\"\\n\\nShe did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance of\\nthe appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship, and of\\ndeference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became a\\nsort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.\\n\\nWhen the distressing communication at Uppercross was over, and he had\\nseen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped, and the\\ndaughter all the better for being with them, he announced his intention\\nof returning in the same carriage to Lyme; and when the horses were\\nbaited, he was off.\\n\\n(End of volume one.)\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n\\nThe remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprehending only two\\ndays, was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the\\nsatisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an\\nimmediate companion, and as assisting in all those arrangements for the\\nfuture, which, in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits,\\nwould have been difficulties.\\n\\nThey had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was much\\nthe same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.  Charles came a\\nfew hours afterwards, to bring a later and more particular account.  He\\nwas tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure must not be hoped, but\\neverything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted.  In\\nspeaking of the Harvilles, he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of\\ntheir kindness, especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.\\n\"She really left nothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had been\\npersuaded to go early to their inn last night.  Mary had been\\nhysterical again this morning.  When he came away, she was going to\\nwalk out with Captain Benwick, which, he hoped, would do her good.  He\\nalmost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before;\\nbut the truth was, that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"\\n\\nCharles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father had at\\nfirst half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.  It\\nwould be going only to multiply trouble to the others, and increase his\\nown distress; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon.  A\\nchaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a far\\nmore useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who\\nhaving brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the\\nlingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after his\\nbrothers, was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and\\ndress all the blains and bruises she could get near her, and who,\\nconsequently, was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse\\ndear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither, had occurred\\nbefore to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta; but without Anne, it would hardly\\nhave been resolved on, and found practicable so soon.\\n\\nThey were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all the minute\\nknowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain every\\ntwenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme, and his\\naccount was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense and\\nconsciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed in\\nCaptain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.\\n\\nAnne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.\\n\"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters for\\none another.\"  And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought she\\ncould not do better than impart among them the general inclination to\\nwhich she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.  She\\nhad little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go; go\\nto-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings, as it\\nsuited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.  They must be\\ntaking off some trouble from the good people she was with; they might\\nat least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children; and in\\nshort, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted with\\nwhat she had done, and felt that she could not spend her last morning\\nat Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations, and sending\\nthem off at an early hour, though her being left to the solitary range\\nof the house was the consequence.\\n\\nShe was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, she was the\\nvery last, the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated\\nboth houses, of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character.\\nA few days had made a change indeed!\\n\\nIf Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  More than former\\nhappiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt, to her mind\\nthere was none, of what would follow her recovery.  A few months hence,\\nand the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self,\\nmight be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that was\\nglowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike Anne\\nElliot!\\n\\nAn hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these, on a dark\\nNovember day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few\\nobjects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make the\\nsound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet, though\\ndesirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House, or look an\\nadieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda,\\nor even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of\\nthe village, without a saddened heart.  Scenes had passed in Uppercross\\nwhich made it precious.  It stood the record of many sensations of\\npain, once severe, but now softened; and of some instances of relenting\\nfeeling, some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could\\nnever be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.  She\\nleft it all behind her, all but the recollection that such things had\\nbeen.\\n\\nAnne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell's house\\nin September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of its\\nbeing possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and\\nescape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\nand elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes of its\\nmistress.\\n\\nThere was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her.\\nShe knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily, either Anne\\nwas improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell fancied her so;\\nand Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion, had the\\namusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin,\\nand of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth\\nand beauty.\\n\\nWhen they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental\\nchange.  The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving\\nKellynch, and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to\\nsmother among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.\\nShe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.\\nTheir concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross; and when Lady\\nRussell reverted to their former hopes and fears, and spoke her\\nsatisfaction in the house in Camden Place, which had been taken, and\\nher regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them, Anne would have\\nbeen ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme\\nand Louisa Musgrove, and all her acquaintance there; how much more\\ninteresting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and\\nCaptain Benwick, than her own father's house in Camden Place, or her\\nown sister's intimacy with Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exert\\nherself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal\\nsolicitude, on topics which had by nature the first claim on her.\\n\\nThere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another\\nsubject.  They must speak of the accident at Lyme.  Lady Russell had\\nnot been arrived five minutes the day before, when a full account of\\nthe whole had burst on her; but still it must be talked of, she must\\nmake enquiries, she must regret the imprudence, lament the result, and\\nCaptain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both.  Anne was conscious\\nof not doing it so well as Lady Russell.  She could not speak the name,\\nand look straight forward to Lady Russell's eye, till she had adopted\\nthe expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment\\nbetween him and Louisa.  When this was told, his name distressed her no\\nlonger.\\n\\nLady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but\\ninternally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,\\nthat the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of\\nthe value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed\\nby a Louisa Musgrove.\\n\\nThe first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme, which\\nfound their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought a rather\\nimproving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period, Lady Russell's\\npoliteness could repose no longer, and the fainter self-threatenings of\\nthe past became in a decided tone, \"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really\\nmust call upon her soon.  Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay\\na visit in that house?  It will be some trial to us both.\"\\n\\nAnne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she\\nsaid, in observing--\\n\\n\"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your\\nfeelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.  By remaining in\\nthe neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.\"\\n\\nShe could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact so high an\\nopinion of the Crofts, and considered her father so very fortunate in\\nhis tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and the\\npoor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamed\\nfor the necessity of the removal, she could not but in conscience feel\\nthat they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall\\nhad passed into better hands than its owners'.  These convictions must\\nunquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they\\nprecluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the\\nhouse again, and returning through the well-known apartments.\\n\\nIn such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself, \"These rooms\\nought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen in their destination!  How\\nunworthily occupied!  An ancient family to be so driven away!\\nStrangers filling their place!\" No, except when she thought of her\\nmother, and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside, she\\nhad no sigh of that description to heave.\\n\\nMrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of\\nfancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion, receiving\\nher in that house, there was particular attention.\\n\\nThe sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic, and on\\ncomparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared that each\\nlady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn; that\\nCaptain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time since\\nthe accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had not been\\nable to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours and then\\nreturned again to Lyme, and without any present intention of quitting\\nit any more.  He had enquired after her, she found, particularly; had\\nexpressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being the worse for her\\nexertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.  This was\\nhandsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could\\nhave done.\\n\\nAs to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one\\nstyle by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to\\nwork on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had\\nbeen the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; that\\nits effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, how\\nlong Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable she\\nwould still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!  The\\nAdmiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this, for a young\\nfellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head, is not it,\\nMiss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster, truly!\"\\n\\nAdmiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady\\nRussell, but they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity\\nof character were irresistible.\\n\\n\"Now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from a\\nlittle reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  I had not\\nrecollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.  But now, do\\nnot stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms in the house\\nif you like it.\"\\n\\n\"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.\"\\n\\n\"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery at\\nany time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by\\nthat door.  A good place is not it?  But,\" (checking himself), \"you\\nwill not think it a good place, for yours were always kept in the\\nbutler's room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.  One man's ways may be\\nas good as another's, but we all like our own best.  And so you must\\njudge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about the\\nhouse or not.\"\\n\\nAnne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.\\n\\n\"We have made very few changes either,\" continued the Admiral, after\\nthinking a moment.  \"Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door, at\\nUppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.  The wonder was,\\nhow any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its\\nopening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter what we have\\ndone, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house\\never had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few\\nalterations we have made have been all very much for the better.  My\\nwife should have the credit of them, however.  I have done very little\\nbesides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my\\ndressing-room, which was your father's.  A very good man, and very much\\nthe gentleman I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliot,\" (looking\\nwith serious reflection), \"I should think he must be rather a dressy\\nman for his time of life.  Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord!\\nthere was no getting away from one's self.  So I got Sophy to lend me a\\nhand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with\\nmy little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I\\nnever go near.\"\\n\\nAnne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,\\nand the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough, took up\\nthe subject again, to say--\\n\\n\"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray give\\nhim my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are settled here\\nquite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place.\\nThe breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only\\nwhen the wind is due north and blows hard, which may not happen three\\ntimes a winter.  And take it altogether, now that we have been into\\nmost of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that we\\nlike better than this.  Pray say so, with my compliments.  He will be\\nglad to hear it.\"\\n\\nLady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other: but\\nthe acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at\\npresent; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced themselves to\\nbe going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions in the north\\nof the county, and probably might not be at home again before Lady\\nRussell would be removing to Bath.\\n\\nSo ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch\\nHall, or of seeing him in company with her friend.  Everything was safe\\nenough, and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on\\nthe subject.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\n\\nThough Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and\\nMrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all\\nwanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; and\\nas soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to\\nthe Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up; but her head,\\nthough clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves susceptible to the\\nhighest extreme of tenderness; and though she might be pronounced to be\\naltogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when she\\nmight be able to bear the removal home; and her father and mother, who\\nmust return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas\\nholidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.\\n\\nThey had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs\\nHarville's children away as much as she could, every possible supply\\nfrom Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to the\\nHarvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner\\nevery day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on each\\nside as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable.\\n\\nMary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident by her\\nstaying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.  Charles\\nHayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when they dined\\nwith the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait, and at\\nfirst Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence; but then,\\nshe had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out\\nwhose daughter she was, and there had been so much going on every day,\\nthere had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles,\\nand she had got books from the library, and changed them so often, that\\nthe balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme.  She had been\\ntaken to Charmouth too, and she had bathed, and she had gone to church,\\nand there were a great many more people to look at in the church at\\nLyme than at Uppercross; and all this, joined to the sense of being so\\nvery useful, had made really an agreeable fortnight.\\n\\nAnne enquired after Captain Benwick. Mary's face was clouded directly.\\nCharles laughed.\\n\\n\"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is a very odd\\nyoung man.  I do not know what he would be at.  We asked him to come\\nhome with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook to give him some\\nshooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it\\nwas all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night, he made a very awkward\\nsort of excuse; 'he never shot' and he had 'been quite misunderstood,'\\nand he had promised this and he had promised that, and the end of it\\nwas, I found, that he did not mean to come.  I suppose he was afraid of\\nfinding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively\\nenough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\nCharles laughed again and said, \"Now Mary, you know very well how it\\nreally was.  It was all your doing,\" (turning to Anne.) \"He fancied\\nthat if he went with us, he should find you close by: he fancied\\neverybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered that Lady\\nRussell lived three miles off, his heart failed him, and he had not\\ncourage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour. Mary knows it is.\"\\n\\nBut Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from not\\nconsidering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in\\nlove with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater\\nattraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed.\\nAnne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she heard.\\nShe boldly acknowledged herself flattered, and continued her enquiries.\\n\\n\"Oh! he talks of you,\" cried Charles, \"in such terms--\" Mary\\ninterrupted him. \"I declare, Charles, I never heard him mention Anne\\ntwice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anne, he never talks of you\\nat all.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" admitted Charles, \"I do not know that he ever does, in a general\\nway; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you\\nexceedingly.  His head is full of some books that he is reading upon\\nyour recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about them; he has\\nfound out something or other in one of them which he thinks--oh! I\\ncannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--I\\noverheard him telling Henrietta all about it; and then 'Miss Elliot'\\nwas spoken of in the highest terms!  Now Mary, I declare it was so, I\\nheard it myself, and you were in the other room.  'Elegance, sweetness,\\nbeauty.' Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot's charms.\"\\n\\n\"And I am sure,\" cried Mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his\\ncredit, if he did.  Miss Harville only died last June.  Such a heart is\\nvery little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure you will\\nagree with me.\"\\n\\n\"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,\" said Lady Russell,\\nsmiling.\\n\\n\"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,\"\\nsaid Charles.  \"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us, and\\nsetting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, he will make\\nhis way over to Kellynch one day by himself, you may depend on it.  I\\ntold him the distance and the road, and I told him of the church's\\nbeing so very well worth seeing; for as he has a taste for those sort\\nof things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he listened with\\nall his understanding and soul; and I am sure from his manner that you\\nwill have him calling here soon.  So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\"\\n\\n\"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,\" was Lady\\nRussell's kind answer.\\n\\n\"Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance,\" said Mary, \"I think he is rather\\nmy acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last\\nfortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to see\\nCaptain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am.\\nHe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked with\\nme, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a\\nword.  He is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not\\nlike him.\"\\n\\n\"There we differ, Mary,\" said Anne.  \"I think Lady Russell would like\\nhim.  I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she\\nwould very soon see no deficiency in his manner.\"\\n\\n\"So do I, Anne,\" said Charles.  \"I am sure Lady Russell would like him.\\nHe is just Lady Russell's sort.  Give him a book, and he will read all\\nday long.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that he will!\" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  \"He will sit poring\\nover his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one\\ndrops one's scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think Lady\\nRussell would like that?\"\\n\\nLady Russell could not help laughing.  \"Upon my word,\" said she, \"I\\nshould not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted\\nof such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may\\ncall myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give\\noccasion to such directly opposite notions.  I wish he may be induced\\nto call here.  And when he does, Mary, you may depend upon hearing my\\nopinion; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand.\"\\n\\n\"You will not like him, I will answer for it.\"\\n\\nLady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke with\\nanimation of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so\\nextraordinarily.\\n\\n\"He is a man,\" said Lady Russell, \"whom I have no wish to see.  His\\ndeclining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, has left\\na very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"\\n\\nThis decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her short in the\\nmidst of the Elliot countenance.\\n\\nWith regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had been\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved, he\\nhad improved, and he was now quite a different creature from what he\\nhad been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa; and was so extremely\\nfearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview, that he did\\nnot press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of\\ngoing away for a week or ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had\\ntalked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade\\nCaptain Benwick to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last,\\nCaptain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally\\nthinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.  Lady Russell could not\\nhear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald; nor\\ncould Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her\\nfather's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without\\nwondering whether she might see him or hear of him.  Captain Benwick\\ncame not, however.  He was either less disposed for it than Charles had\\nimagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him a week's indulgence,\\nLady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had\\nbeen beginning to excite.\\n\\nThe Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from\\nschool, bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve\\nthe noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained\\nwith Louisa; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual\\nquarters.\\n\\nLady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once, when Anne\\ncould not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.\\nThough neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor Captain\\nWentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as could\\nbe wished to the last state she had seen it in.\\n\\nImmediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whom\\nshe was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from\\nthe Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side was a table\\noccupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; and\\non the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn\\nand cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the whole\\ncompleted by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be\\nheard, in spite of all the noise of the others.  Charles and Mary also\\ncame in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of\\npaying his respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten\\nminutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the\\nchildren on his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.\\n\\nAnne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed such a\\ndomestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Louisa's\\nillness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove, who got Anne\\nnear her on purpose to thank her most cordially, again and again, for\\nall her attentions to them, concluded a short recapitulation of what\\nshe had suffered herself by observing, with a happy glance round the\\nroom, that after all she had gone through, nothing was so likely to do\\nher good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home.\\n\\nLouisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her\\nbeing able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters\\nwent to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her and\\nstay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,\\nfor the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.\\n\\n\"I hope I shall remember, in future,\" said Lady Russell, as soon as\\nthey were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at Uppercross in the\\nChristmas holidays.\"\\n\\nEverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; and\\nsounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort rather\\nthan their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards, was\\nentering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long course\\nof streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place, amidst the dash of\\nother carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of\\nnewspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink of\\npattens, she made no complaint.  No, these were noises which belonged\\nto the winter pleasures; her spirits rose under their influence; and\\nlike Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling, though not saying, that after being\\nlong in the country, nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet\\ncheerfulness.\\n\\nAnne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,\\nthough very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view\\nof the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeing\\nthem better; felt their progress through the streets to be, however\\ndisagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her when she\\narrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles of\\nUppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.\\n\\nElizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some\\ninterest.  Mr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; had\\ncalled a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If\\nElizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking\\nmuch pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the\\nconnection, as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was\\nvery wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very\\nagreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting\\nthe sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being \"a man\\nwhom she had no wish to see.\"  She had a great wish to see him.  If he\\nreally sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be\\nforgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.\\n\\nAnne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance, but she\\nfelt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not, which was more\\nthan she could say for many other persons in Bath.\\n\\nShe was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to her\\nown lodgings, in Rivers Street.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\n\\nSir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a lofty\\ndignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and both he\\nand Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.\\n\\nAnne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of\\nmany months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"Oh! when shall I leave\\nyou again?\"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome\\nshe received, did her good.  Her father and sister were glad to see\\nher, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture, and met her\\nwith kindness.  Her making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, was\\nnoticed as an advantage.\\n\\nMrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and\\nsmiles were more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she\\nwould pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of\\nthe others was unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination to\\nlisten to her.  After laying out for some compliments of being deeply\\nregretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay, they\\nhad only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be all\\ntheir own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it\\nwas all Bath.\\n\\nThey had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered\\ntheir expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly the\\nbest in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the\\nsuperiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste\\nof the furniture.  Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after.\\nEverybody was wanting to visit them.  They had drawn back from many\\nintroductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people\\nof whom they knew nothing.\\n\\nHere were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father and\\nsister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh that her\\nfather should feel no degradation in his change, should see nothing to\\nregret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, should\\nfind so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and she must\\nsigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open the\\nfolding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the\\nother, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman, who\\nhad been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of\\nbetween two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.\\n\\nBut this was not all which they had to make them happy.  They had Mr\\nElliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.  He was not\\nonly pardoned, they were delighted with him.  He had been in Bath about\\na fortnight; (he had passed through Bath in November, in his way to\\nLondon, when the intelligence of Sir Walter's being settled there had\\nof course reached him, though only twenty-four hours in the place, but\\nhe had not been able to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a\\nfortnight in Bath, and his first object on arriving, had been to leave\\nhis card in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours\\nto meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be\\nreceived as a relation again, that their former good understanding was\\ncompletely re-established.\\n\\nThey had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away all the\\nappearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated in\\nmisapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of throwing himself\\noff; he had feared that he was thrown off, but knew not why, and\\ndelicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint of having spoken\\ndisrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, he\\nwas quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and\\nwhose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the\\nunfeudal tone of the present day.  He was astonished, indeed, but his\\ncharacter and general conduct must refute it.  He could refer Sir\\nWalter to all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been taking\\non this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the\\nfooting of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his\\nopinions on the subject.\\n\\nThe circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of much\\nextenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but\\na very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable\\nman, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter\\nadded), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and\\nhad, at his own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance\\nthrough Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the\\nmarriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it.\\n\\nColonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted also\\nwith his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.  She was\\ncertainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich,\\nand excessively in love with his friend.  There had been the charm.\\nShe had sought him.  Without that attraction, not all her money would\\nhave tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of her\\nhaving been a very fine woman.  Here was a great deal to soften the\\nbusiness.  A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him!\\nSir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology; and though Elizabeth\\ncould not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light, she\\nallowed it be a great extenuation.\\n\\nMr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidently\\ndelighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinners\\nin general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, and\\nplacing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.\\n\\nAnne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances, large\\nallowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.\\nShe heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant or\\nirrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\nbut in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had the\\nsensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, in\\nMr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be well\\nreceived by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain by being\\non terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.  In\\nall probability he was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch\\nestate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.  A sensible man,\\nand he had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an object\\nto him?  She could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, for\\nElizabeth's sake.  There might really have been a liking formerly,\\nthough convenience and accident had drawn him a different way; and now\\nthat he could afford to please himself, he might mean to pay his\\naddresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, with\\nwell-bred, elegant manners, and her character might never have been\\npenetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public, and when very young\\nhimself.  How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation\\nof his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a\\nfearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too\\nnice, or too observant if Elizabeth were his object; and that Elizabeth\\nwas disposed to believe herself so, and that her friend Mrs Clay was\\nencouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them,\\nwhile Mr Elliot's frequent visits were talked of.\\n\\nAnne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without\\nbeing much attended to.  \"Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.\\nThey did not know.  It might be him, perhaps.\"  They could not listen\\nto her description of him.  They were describing him themselves; Sir\\nWalter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\nappearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face, his\\nsensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being very much\\nunder-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could he\\npretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for\\nthe worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think that he (Sir Walter) was\\nlooking exactly as he had done when they last parted;\" but Sir Walter\\nhad \"not been able to return the compliment entirely, which had\\nembarrassed him.  He did not mean to complain, however.  Mr Elliot was\\nbetter to look at than most men, and he had no objection to being seen\\nwith him anywhere.\"\\n\\nMr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of the\\nwhole evening.  \"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced\\nto them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\" and there was a Mrs\\nWallis, at present known only to them by description, as she was in\\ndaily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as \"a\\nmost charming woman, quite worthy of being known in Camden Place,\" and\\nas soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.  Sir Walter\\nthought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be an excessively pretty\\nwoman, beautiful.  \"He longed to see her.  He hoped she might make some\\namends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the\\nstreets.  The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women.  He did\\nnot mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the\\nplain was out of all proportion.  He had frequently observed, as he\\nwalked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or\\nfive-and-thirty frights; and once, as he had stood in a shop on Bond\\nStreet, he had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another,\\nwithout there being a tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty\\nmorning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a\\nthousand could stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were a\\ndreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!  they\\nwere infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\nIt was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\ntolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.  He\\nhad never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis (who was a\\nfine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing that every\\nwoman's eye was upon him; every woman's eye was sure to be upon Colonel\\nWallis.\"  Modest Sir Walter!  He was not allowed to escape, however.\\nHis daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis's\\ncompanion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly\\nwas not sandy-haired.\\n\\n\"How is Mary looking?\" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good\\nhumour.  \"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that\\nmay not happen every day.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general she has been\\nin very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.\"\\n\\n\"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds, and grow\\ncoarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse.\"\\n\\nAnne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,\\nor a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the\\ndoor suspended everything.  \"A knock at the door! and so late!  It was\\nten o'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine in\\nLansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way home\\nto ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.  Mrs Clay\\ndecidedly thought it Mr Elliot's knock.\"  Mrs Clay was right.  With all\\nthe state which a butler and foot-boy could give, Mr Elliot was ushered\\ninto the room.\\n\\nIt was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.\\nAnne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments, and\\nher sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour, but \"he\\ncould not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her\\nfriend had taken cold the day before,\" &c. &c; which was all as\\npolitely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part must\\nfollow then.  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter; \"Mr Elliot\\nmust give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\" (there was\\nno occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and blushing, very\\nbecomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no\\nmeans forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement at his little start\\nof surprise, that he had not been at all aware of who she was.  He\\nlooked completely astonished, but not more astonished than pleased; his\\neyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the\\nrelationship, alluded to the past, and entreated to be received as an\\nacquaintance already.  He was quite as good-looking as he had appeared\\nat Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking, and his manners were so\\nexactly what they ought to be, so polished, so easy, so particularly\\nagreeable, that she could compare them in excellence to only one\\nperson's manners.  They were not the same, but they were, perhaps,\\nequally good.\\n\\nHe sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.\\nThere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes were\\nenough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions, his choice of\\nsubject, his knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of a\\nsensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he could, he began to talk to\\nher of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, but\\nespecially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to\\nbe guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his own route,\\nunderstand something of hers, and regret that he should have lost such\\nan opportunity of paying his respects to her.  She gave him a short\\naccount of her party and business at Lyme.  His regret increased as he\\nlistened.  He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room\\nadjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought they\\nmust be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, but\\ncertainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow\\nof a right to introduce himself.  If he had but asked who the party\\nwere!  The name of Musgrove would have told him enough.  \"Well, it\\nwould serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a\\nquestion at an inn, which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on\\nthe principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious.\\n\\n\"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he, \"as to\\nwhat is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing, are more\\nabsurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings in the world.\\nThe folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the\\nfolly of what they have in view.\"\\n\\nBut he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone: he knew\\nit; he was soon diffused again among the others, and it was only at\\nintervals that he could return to Lyme.\\n\\nHis enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene she\\nhad been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.  Having\\nalluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole.  When he questioned,\\nSir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also, but the difference in\\ntheir manner of doing it could not be unfelt.  She could only compare\\nMr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish of really comprehending what had\\npassed, and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in\\nwitnessing it.\\n\\nHe staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece\\nhad struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman was\\nbeginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale, before Mr\\nElliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.\\n\\nAnne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\nCamden Place could have passed so well!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\n\\nThere was one point which Anne, on returning to her family, would have\\nbeen more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's being in love\\nwith Elizabeth, which was, her father's not being in love with Mrs\\nClay; and she was very far from easy about it, when she had been at\\nhome a few hours.  On going down to breakfast the next morning, she\\nfound there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side of\\nmeaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said, that\\n\"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself at all wanted;\"\\nfor Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper, \"That must not be any\\nreason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.  She is nothing to me,\\ncompared with you;\"  and she was in full time to hear her father say,\\n\"My dear madam, this must not be.  As yet, you have seen nothing of\\nBath.  You have been here only to be useful.  You must not run away\\nfrom us now.  You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis, the\\nbeautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind, I well know the sight of\\nbeauty is a real gratification.\"\\n\\nHe spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised to\\nsee Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.  Her\\ncountenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praise\\nof the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister.  The\\nlady could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay.\\n\\nIn the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be\\nalone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks; he\\nthought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, her\\ncomplexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she been using any\\nthing in particular?\"  \"No, nothing.\"  \"Merely Gowland,\" he supposed.\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"  \"Ha! he was surprised at that;\" and added,\\n\"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannot\\nbe better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of\\nGowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been using it at my\\nrecommendation, and you see what it has done for her.  You see how it\\nhas carried away her freckles.\"\\n\\nIf Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise might\\nhave struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne that the\\nfreckles were at all lessened.  But everything must take its chance.\\nThe evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were also\\nto marry.  As for herself, she might always command a home with Lady\\nRussell.\\n\\nLady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\non this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs\\nClay in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual\\nprovocation to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a\\nperson in Bath who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and\\nhas a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.\\n\\nAs Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable, or more\\nindifferent, towards the others.  His manners were an immediate\\nrecommendation; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully\\nsupporting the superficial, that she was at first, as she told Anne,\\nalmost ready to exclaim, \"Can this be Mr Elliot?\" and could not\\nseriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man.\\nEverything united in him; good understanding, correct opinions,\\nknowledge of the world, and a warm heart.  He had strong feelings of\\nfamily attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; he\\nlived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; he\\njudged for himself in everything essential, without defying public\\nopinion in any point of worldly decorum.  He was steady, observant,\\nmoderate, candid; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness,\\nwhich fancied itself strong feeling; and yet, with a sensibility to\\nwhat was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities of\\ndomestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent\\nagitation seldom really possess.  She was sure that he had not been\\nhappy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it;\\nbut it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty\\nsoon to suspect) to prevent his thinking of a second choice.  Her\\nsatisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.\\n\\nIt was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her\\nexcellent friend could sometimes think differently; and it did not\\nsurprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell should see nothing\\nsuspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require more motives than\\nappeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation.  In Lady\\nRussell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot, at a mature\\ntime of life, should feel it a most desirable object, and what would\\nvery generally recommend him among all sensible people, to be on good\\nterms with the head of his family; the simplest process in the world of\\ntime upon a head naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday of\\nyouth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it, and at last to\\nmention \"Elizabeth.\"  Lady Russell listened, and looked, and made only\\nthis cautious reply:--\"Elizabeth! very well; time will explain.\"\\n\\nIt was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little\\nobservation, felt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing at\\npresent.  In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the\\nhabit of such general observance as \"Miss Elliot,\" that any\\nparticularity of attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliot, too,\\nit must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.  A little\\ndelay on his side might be very excusable.  In fact, Anne could never\\nsee the crape round his hat, without fearing that she was the\\ninexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations; for though\\nhis marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many\\nyears that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the\\nawful impression of its being dissolved.\\n\\nHowever it might end, he was without any question their pleasantest\\nacquaintance in Bath:  she saw nobody equal to him; and it was a great\\nindulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme, which he seemed to\\nhave as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as herself.\\nThey went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many\\ntimes.  He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some\\nearnestness.  She knew it well; and she remembered another person's\\nlook also.\\n\\nThey did not always think alike.  His value for rank and connexion she\\nperceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance, it\\nmust be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly into her\\nfather and sister's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy\\nto excite them.  The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of\\nthe Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and her daughter, the Honourable\\nMiss Carteret; and all the comfort of No. --, Camden Place, was swept\\naway for many days; for the Dalrymples (in Anne's opinion, most\\nunfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots; and the agony was how to\\nintroduce themselves properly.\\n\\nAnne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with\\nnobility, and she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She had hoped\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, and\\nwas reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen; a wish that\\nthey had more pride; for \"our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss\\nCarteret;\" \"our cousins, the Dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears all day\\nlong.\\n\\nSir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount, but had\\nnever seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties of the\\ncase arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by\\nletters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,\\nwhen, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's at the same\\ntime, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.  No letter of\\ncondolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect had been visited on\\nthe head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no\\nletter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there\\nwas but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the\\nrelationship as closed.  How to have this anxious business set to\\nrights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question:  and it was\\na question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor\\nMr Elliot thought unimportant.  \"Family connexions were always worth\\npreserving, good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken\\na house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in\\nstyle.  She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had\\nheard her spoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that\\nthe connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.\"\\n\\nSir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote a\\nvery fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to his\\nright honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could\\nadmire the letter; but it did all that was wanted, in bringing three\\nlines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.  \"She was very much\\nhonoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\" The toils of the\\nbusiness were over, the sweets began.  They visited in Laura Place,\\nthey had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and the Honourable\\nMiss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might be most visible:  and\\n\"Our cousins in Laura Place,\"--\"Our cousin, Lady Dalrymple and Miss\\nCarteret,\" were talked of to everybody.\\n\\nAnne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very\\nagreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they\\ncreated, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,\\naccomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name\\nof \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer for\\neverybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so\\nawkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but\\nfor her birth.\\n\\nLady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet \"it\\nwas an acquaintance worth having;\" and when Anne ventured to speak her\\nopinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing in\\nthemselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as good\\ncompany, as those who would collect good company around them, they had\\ntheir value.  Anne smiled and said,\\n\\n\"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,\\nwell-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is\\nwhat I call good company.\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company; that is\\nthe best.  Good company requires only birth, education, and manners,\\nand with regard to education is not very nice.  Birth and good manners\\nare essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing\\nin good company; on the contrary, it will do very well.  My cousin Anne\\nshakes her head.  She is not satisfied.  She is fastidious.  My dear\\ncousin\" (sitting down by her), \"you have a better right to be\\nfastidious than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?\\nWill it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society of\\nthose good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages of the\\nconnexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it, that they will\\nmove in the first set in Bath this winter, and as rank is rank, your\\nbeing known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your\\nfamily (our family let me say) in that degree of consideration which we\\nmust all wish for.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" sighed Anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\"\\nthen recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,\\n\"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to\\nprocure the acquaintance.  I suppose\" (smiling) \"I have more pride than\\nany of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so\\nsolicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very\\nsure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.  In London,\\nperhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say:\\nbut in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth\\nknowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Anne, \"I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place.\"\\n\\n\"I love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural.  But here you\\nare in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all the\\ncredit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.  You\\ntalk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish to\\nbelieve myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would have\\nthe same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a little\\ndifferent.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,\" (he continued,\\nspeaking lower, though there was no one else in the room) \"in one\\npoint, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that every addition\\nto your father's society, among his equals or superiors, may be of use\\nin diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\"\\n\\nHe looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately\\noccupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant; and\\nthough Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting great\\nacquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\n\\nWhile Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good\\nfortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very\\ndifferent description.\\n\\nShe had called on her former governess, and had heard from her of there\\nbeing an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims on\\nher attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,\\nnow Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her\\nlife when it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved, feeling\\nher separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, of\\nstrong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;\\nand Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the\\nwant of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at\\nschool, had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably\\nlessened her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.\\n\\nMiss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards, was\\nsaid to have married a man of fortune, and this was all that Anne had\\nknown of her, till now that their governess's account brought her\\nsituation forward in a more decided but very different form.\\n\\nShe was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant; and at his\\ndeath, about two years before, had left his affairs dreadfully\\ninvolved.  She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and\\nin addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe\\nrheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs, had made her for\\nthe present a cripple.  She had come to Bath on that account, and was\\nnow in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable\\neven to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost\\nexcluded from society.\\n\\nTheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from\\nMiss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time in\\ngoing.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard, or what she\\nintended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.  She only\\nconsulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments, and\\nwas most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings in\\nWestgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.\\n\\nThe visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest\\nin each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes had its\\nawkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone since they had\\nparted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the\\nother had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming,\\nsilent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of\\nseven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as\\nconsciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years had\\ntransformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glow\\nof health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless\\nwidow, receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour; but all\\nthat was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left\\nonly the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and\\ntalking over old times.\\n\\nAnne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she\\nhad almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be\\ncheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations of the\\npast--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions of\\nthe present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her\\nheart or ruined her spirits.\\n\\nIn the course of a second visit she talked with great openness, and\\nAnne's astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine a more\\ncheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.  She had been very fond\\nof her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been used to affluence:\\nit was gone.  She had no child to connect her with life and happiness\\nagain, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs,\\nno health to make all the rest supportable.  Her accommodations were\\nlimited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no\\npossibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which\\nthere was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never\\nquitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.  Yet, in spite\\nof all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of\\nlanguor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment.  How\\ncould it be?  She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined\\nthat this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only.  A\\nsubmissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply\\nresolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of\\nmind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily\\nfrom evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of\\nherself, which was from nature alone.  It was the choicest gift of\\nHeaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which,\\nby a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost\\nevery other want.\\n\\nThere had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits had nearly\\nfailed.  She could not call herself an invalid now, compared with her\\nstate on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed, been a pitiable\\nobject; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken\\npossession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and\\nsuffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers,\\nwith the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at\\nthat moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense.  She\\nhad weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her\\ngood.  It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be\\nin good hands.  She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or\\ndisinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her\\nthat her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her\\nill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister\\nof her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in\\nthat house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to\\nattend her.  \"And she,\" said Mrs Smith, \"besides nursing me most\\nadmirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I\\ncould use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great\\namusement; and she put me in the way of making these little\\nthread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so\\nbusy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.  She had a\\nlarge acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can\\nafford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.  She always takes\\nthe right time for applying.  Everybody's heart is open, you know, when\\nthey have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the\\nblessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to\\nspeak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman.  Hers is a line\\nfor seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense and\\nobservation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior to\\nthousands of those who having only received 'the best education in the\\nworld,' know nothing worth attending to.  Call it gossip, if you will,\\nbut when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, she is\\nsure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable:\\nsomething that makes one know one's species better.  One likes to hear\\nwhat is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being\\ntrifling and silly.  To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I\\nassure you, is a treat.\"\\n\\nAnne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, \"I can easily\\nbelieve it.  Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they\\nare intelligent may be well worth listening to.  Such varieties of\\nhuman nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!  And it is not\\nmerely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it\\noccasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or\\naffecting.  What instances must pass before them of ardent,\\ndisinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,\\npatience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\nthat ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of\\nvolumes.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may, though I fear\\nits lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.  Here and\\nthere, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally\\nspeaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a\\nsick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity\\nand fortitude, that one hears of.  There is so little real friendship\\nin the world! and unfortunately\" (speaking low and tremulously) \"there\\nare so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late.\"\\n\\nAnne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been what he\\nought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made\\nher think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.  It was but a\\npassing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off, and soon\\nadded in a different tone--\\n\\n\"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing\\nMrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,\\nfashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report\\nbut of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis,\\nhowever.  She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all the\\nhigh-priced things I have in hand now.\"\\n\\nAnne had called several times on her friend, before the existence of\\nsuch a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary\\nto speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one\\nmorning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple\\nfor the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that\\nevening in Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.  They\\nwere only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept at\\nhome by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had\\nbeen so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account with great\\nalacrity--\"She was engaged to spend the evening with an old\\nschoolfellow.\"  They were not much interested in anything relative to\\nAnne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it\\nunderstood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was\\ndisdainful, and Sir Walter severe.\\n\\n\"Westgate Buildings!\" said he, \"and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be\\nvisiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith; and\\nwho was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to\\nbe met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?  That she is old\\nand sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most\\nextraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts other people, low\\ncompany, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting\\nto you.  But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow:  she\\nis not so near her end, I presume, but that she may hope to see another\\nday.  What is her age?  Forty?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off\\nmy engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will\\nat once suit her and myself.  She goes into the warm bath to-morrow,\\nand for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\"\\n\\n\"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked\\nElizabeth.\\n\\n\"She sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied Anne; \"on the contrary, she\\napproves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs\\nSmith.\"\\n\\n\"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed Sir Walter.  \"Sir\\nHenry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known to\\nconvey a Miss Elliot.  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!\\nA poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs\\nSmith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names in the\\nworld, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferred\\nby her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and\\nIreland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!\"\\n\\nMrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it\\nadvisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did\\nlong to say a little in defence of her friend's not very dissimilar\\nclaims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect to her father\\nprevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it to himself to\\nrecollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty\\nand forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity.\\n\\nAnne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course she\\nheard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.  She had\\nbeen the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had\\nnot only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves, but had\\nactually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others, and had\\nbeen at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and Mr\\nElliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady\\nRussell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait\\non her.  Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could\\nsupply from Lady Russell.  To her, its greatest interest must be, in\\nhaving been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot; in\\nhaving been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for\\nstaying away in such a cause.  Her kind, compassionate visits to this\\nold schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr\\nElliot.  He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her\\ntemper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.  He could meet\\neven Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be\\ngiven to understand so much by her friend, could not know herself to be\\nso highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable\\nsensations which her friend meant to create.\\n\\nLady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.\\nShe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his\\ndeserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which\\nwould free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and\\nleave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.  She\\nwould not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the\\nsubject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be\\nhereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness\\nof the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.\\nAnne heard her, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled,\\nblushed, and gently shook her head.\\n\\n\"I am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said Lady Russell, \"being much\\ntoo well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.\\nI only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses\\nto you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think there\\nwould be every possibility of your being happy together.  A most\\nsuitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be\\na very happy one.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects I\\nthink highly of him,\" said Anne; \"but we should not suit.\"\\n\\nLady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"I own that to\\nbe able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future\\nLady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother's\\nplace, succeeding to all her rights, and all her popularity, as well as\\nto all her virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me.\\nYou are your mother's self in countenance and disposition; and if I\\nmight be allowed to fancy you such as she was, in situation and name,\\nand home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to\\nher in being more highly valued!  My dearest Anne, it would give me\\nmore delight than is often felt at my time of life!\"\\n\\nAnne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,\\nand, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings\\nthis picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart\\nwere bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her mother had been; of\\nhaving the precious name of \"Lady Elliot\" first revived in herself; of\\nbeing restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again, her home for\\never, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.  Lady Russell\\nsaid not another word, willing to leave the matter to its own\\noperation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment with\\npropriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short, what Anne\\ndid not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself\\nbrought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch and of \"Lady\\nElliot\" all faded away.  She never could accept him.  And it was not\\nonly that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one; her\\njudgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a\\ncase was against Mr Elliot.\\n\\nThough they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied\\nthat she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man, an\\nagreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions, seemed to\\njudge properly and as a man of principle, this was all clear enough.\\nHe certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix on any one article\\nof moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would have been\\nafraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past, if not the\\npresent.  The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, the\\nallusions to former practices and pursuits, suggested suspicions not\\nfavourable of what he had been.  She saw that there had been bad\\nhabits; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing; that there had\\nbeen a period of his life (and probably not a short one) when he had\\nbeen, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though he might\\nnow think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of\\na clever, cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair\\ncharacter?  How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly\\ncleansed?\\n\\nMr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.  There\\nwas never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,\\nat the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decided\\nimperfection.  Her early impressions were incurable.  She prized the\\nfrank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.  Warmth\\nand enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could so\\nmuch more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or\\nsaid a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind\\nnever varied, whose tongue never slipped.\\n\\nMr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers in\\nher father's house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well, stood\\ntoo well with every body.  He had spoken to her with some degree of\\nopenness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was\\nabout, and to hold her in contempt; and yet Mrs Clay found him as\\nagreeable as any body.\\n\\nLady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend, for she saw\\nnothing to excite distrust.  She could not imagine a man more exactly\\nwhat he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter\\nfeeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved\\nAnne in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\n\\nIt was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in\\nBath, was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.  She\\nwanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.  It was three\\nweeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew that Henrietta was at\\nhome again; and that Louisa, though considered to be recovering fast,\\nwas still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all very intently one\\nevening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to\\nher; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise, with Admiral and Mrs\\nCroft's compliments.\\n\\nThe Crofts must be in Bath!  A circumstance to interest her.  They were\\npeople whom her heart turned to very naturally.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" cried Sir Walter.  \"The Crofts have arrived in Bath?\\nThe Crofts who rent Kellynch?  What have they brought you?\"\\n\\n\"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure an\\nintroduction.  I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any\\nrate.  I know what is due to my tenant.\"\\n\\nAnne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how the poor\\nAdmiral's complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.  It had been\\nbegun several days back.\\n\\n\\n\"February 1st.\\n\\n\"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know how\\nlittle people think of letters in such a place as Bath.  You must be a\\ngreat deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know,\\naffords little to write about.  We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr\\nand Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays.  I do\\nnot reckon the Hayters as anybody.  The holidays, however, are over at\\nlast:  I believe no children ever had such long ones.  I am sure I had\\nnot.  The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles;\\nbut you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home.  Mrs\\nHarville must be an odd mother to part with them so long.  I do not\\nunderstand it.  They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but\\nMrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than her\\ngrandchildren.  What dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt\\nin Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some\\nconsequence.  I have not had a creature call on me since the second\\nweek in January, except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much\\noftener than was welcome.  Between ourselves, I think it a great pity\\nHenrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have kept\\nher a little out of his way.  The carriage is gone to-day, to bring\\nLouisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.  We are not asked to dine with\\nthem, however, till the day after, Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her\\nbeing fatigued by the journey, which is not very likely, considering\\nthe care that will be taken of her; and it would be much more\\nconvenient to me to dine there to-morrow.  I am glad you find Mr Elliot\\nso agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with him too; but I have\\nmy usual luck:  I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is\\ngoing on; always the last of my family to be noticed.  What an immense\\ntime Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth!  Does she never mean to\\ngo away?  But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant, we might\\nnot be invited.  Let me know what you think of this.  I do not expect\\nmy children to be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House\\nvery well, for a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the\\nCrofts are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral\\ngouty.  Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the\\ncivility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.  I do\\nnot think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me\\nin love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,\\n\\n\"Mary M---.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has just\\ntold me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much\\nabout.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats, you know, are\\nalways worse than anybody's.\"\\n\\n\\nSo ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an\\nenvelope, containing nearly as much more.\\n\\n\\n\"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa bore her\\njourney, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal to add.\\nIn the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday, offering to\\nconvey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed, addressed to\\nme, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as\\nlong as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely\\nhope Bath will do him all the good he wants.  I shall be truly glad to\\nhave them back again.  Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant\\nfamily.  But now for Louisa.  I have something to communicate that will\\nastonish you not a little.  She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very\\nsafely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we were\\nrather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had\\nbeen invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the\\nreason?  Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and\\nnot choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr\\nMusgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came\\naway, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.  True, upon\\nmy honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised at least if\\nyou ever received a hint of it, for I never did.  Mrs Musgrove protests\\nsolemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.  We are all very well\\npleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain\\nWentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove\\nhas written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day.  Mrs\\nHarville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister's\\naccount; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both.  Indeed,\\nMrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having\\nnursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if\\nyou remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see\\nanything of it.  And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick's\\nbeing supposed to be an admirer of yours.  How Charles could take such\\na thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me.  I hope he\\nwill be more agreeable now.  Certainly not a great match for Louisa\\nMusgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters.\"\\n\\n\\nMary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared for\\nthe news.  She had never in her life been more astonished.  Captain\\nBenwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful for belief,\\nand it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room,\\npreserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions of the\\nmoment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter wanted to\\nknow whether the Crofts travelled with four horses, and whether they\\nwere likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss\\nElliot and himself to visit in; but had little curiosity beyond.\\n\\n\"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer, \"And\\npray what brings the Crofts to Bath?\"\\n\\n\"They come on the Admiral's account.  He is thought to be gouty.\"\\n\\n\"Gout and decrepitude!\" said Sir Walter.  \"Poor old gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"Have they any acquaintance here?\" asked Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's time\\nof life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance in\\nsuch a place as this.\"\\n\\n\"I suspect,\" said Sir Walter coolly, \"that Admiral Croft will be best\\nknown in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.  Elizabeth, may we\\nventure to present him and his wife in Laura Place?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she\\nmight not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify; but\\nas cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.  We\\nhad better leave the Crofts to find their own level.  There are several\\nodd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors.  The\\nCrofts will associate with them.\"\\n\\nThis was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's share of interest in the letter;\\nwhen Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention, in an\\nenquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys, Anne was\\nat liberty.\\n\\nIn her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder\\nhow Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,\\nhad given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.\\nShe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akin\\nto ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure that\\nsuch a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.\\n\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited, joyous-talking\\nLouisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking, feeling, reading, Captain\\nBenwick, seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other.\\nTheir minds most dissimilar!  Where could have been the attraction?\\nThe answer soon presented itself.  It had been in situation.  They had\\nbeen thrown together several weeks; they had been living in the same\\nsmall family party:  since Henrietta's coming away, they must have been\\ndepending almost entirely on each other, and Louisa, just recovering\\nfrom illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was\\nnot inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne had not been able to\\navoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as\\nMary, from the present course of events, they served only to confirm\\nthe idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself.\\nShe did not mean, however, to derive much more from it to gratify her\\nvanity, than Mary might have allowed.  She was persuaded that any\\ntolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for\\nhim would have received the same compliment.  He had an affectionate\\nheart.  He must love somebody.\\n\\nShe saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine naval\\nfervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.  He would\\ngain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott\\nand Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already; of course they\\nhad fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned\\ninto a person of literary taste, and sentimental reflection was\\namusing, but she had no doubt of its being so.  The day at Lyme, the\\nfall from the Cobb, might influence her health, her nerves, her\\ncourage, her character to the end of her life, as thoroughly as it\\nappeared to have influenced her fate.\\n\\nThe conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been\\nsensible of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer\\nanother man, there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting\\nwonder; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly\\nnothing to be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne's heart\\nbeat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks when\\nshe thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.  She had some\\nfeelings which she was ashamed to investigate.  They were too much like\\njoy, senseless joy!\\n\\nShe longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it was\\nevident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.  The visit of\\nceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned, and\\nCaptain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.\\n\\nThe Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street, perfectly\\nto Sir Walter's satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed of the\\nacquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more about\\nthe Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.\\n\\nThe Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for, and\\nconsidered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.  They brought\\nwith them their country habit of being almost always together.  He was\\nordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares\\nwith him in everything, and to walk for her life to do him good.  Anne\\nsaw them wherever she went.  Lady Russell took her out in her carriage\\nalmost every morning, and she never failed to think of them, and never\\nfailed to see them.  Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most\\nattractive picture of happiness to her.  She always watched them as\\nlong as she could, delighted to fancy she understood what they might be\\ntalking of, as they walked along in happy independence, or equally\\ndelighted to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he\\nencountered an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.\\n\\nAnne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking\\nherself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days\\nafter the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend, or\\nher friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return alone\\nto Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good\\nfortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing by himself at a\\nprintshop window, with his hands behind him, in earnest contemplation\\nof some print, and she not only might have passed him unseen, but was\\nobliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his\\nnotice.  When he did perceive and acknowledge her, however, it was done\\nwith all his usual frankness and good humour.  \"Ha! is it you?  Thank\\nyou, thank you.  This is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you\\nsee, staring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without\\nstopping.  But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.\\nDid you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters must\\nbe, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\nold cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it\\nmightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and\\nmountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they\\ncertainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!\" (laughing\\nheartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it.  Well,\"\\n(turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere for you,\\nor with you?  Can I be of any use?\"\\n\\n\"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your\\ncompany the little way our road lies together.  I am going home.\"\\n\\n\\n\"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes we will\\nhave a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you as we go\\nalong.  There, take my arm; that's right; I do not feel comfortable if\\nI have not a woman there.  Lord! what a boat it is!\" taking a last look\\nat the picture, as they began to be in motion.\\n\\n\"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have, presently.  But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I\\nshall only say, 'How d'ye do?' as we pass, however.  I shall not stop.\\n'How d'ye do?'  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.\\nShe, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on one of her\\nheels, as large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across the\\nstreet, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.  Shabby\\nfellows, both of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.\\nSophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once: got away\\nwith some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story another\\ntime.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.  Look, he\\nsees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.  Ah! the\\npeace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald!  How\\ndo you like Bath, Miss Elliot?  It suits us very well.  We are always\\nmeeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every\\nmorning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them\\nall, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and\\nare as snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at\\nNorth Yarmouth and Deal.  We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I\\ncan tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North\\nYarmouth.  The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same\\nway.\"\\n\\nWhen they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again for\\nwhat he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to\\nhave her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait, for\\nthe Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the\\ngreater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was not really Mrs\\nCroft, she must let him have his own way.  As soon as they were fairly\\nascending Belmont, he began--\\n\\n\"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.  But first\\nof all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk\\nabout.  That young lady, you know, that we have all been so concerned\\nfor.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to.  Her\\nChristian name:  I always forget her Christian name.\"\\n\\nAnne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\ndid; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"Louisa.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies\\nhad not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be out\\nif they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well, this Miss\\nLouisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.  He was\\ncourting her week after week.  The only wonder was, what they could be\\nwaiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clear\\nenough that they must wait till her brain was set to right.  But even\\nthen there was something odd in their way of going on.  Instead of\\nstaying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he went off to see\\nEdward.  When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward's,\\nand there he has been ever since.  We have seen nothing of him since\\nNovember.  Even Sophy could not understand it.  But now, the matter has\\ntaken the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss\\nMusgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James\\nBenwick.  You know James Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she is to marry him.  Nay, most likely they are married already,\\nfor I do not know what they should wait for.\"\\n\\n\"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said Anne, \"and\\nI understand that he bears an excellent character.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.\\nHe is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad\\ntimes for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.  An\\nexcellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous\\nofficer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for that\\nsoft sort of manner does not do him justice.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of\\nspirit from Captain Benwick's manners.  I thought them particularly\\npleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather\\ntoo piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,\\nSophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick's manners better than his.\\nThere is something about Frederick more to our taste.\"\\n\\nAnne was caught.  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of\\nspirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other, not at all to\\nrepresent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best that could\\npossibly be; and, after a little hesitation, she was beginning to say,\\n\"I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends,\" but the\\nAdmiral interrupted her with--\\n\\n\"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.  We\\nhave it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter from him\\nyesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it in a\\nletter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.  I fancy\\nthey are all at Uppercross.\"\\n\\nThis was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said,\\ntherefore, \"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of\\nCaptain Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly\\nuneasy.  It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment\\nbetween him and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to\\nhave worn out on each side equally, and without violence.  I hope his\\nletter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from\\nbeginning to end.\"\\n\\nAnne looked down to hide her smile.\\n\\n\"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has too much\\nspirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better, it is very fit\\nshe should have him.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing in\\nCaptain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks\\nhimself ill-used by his friend, which might appear, you know, without\\nits being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry that such a\\nfriendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be\\ndestroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at all of that\\nnature in the letter.  He does not give the least fling at Benwick;\\ndoes not so much as say, 'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for\\nwondering at it.'  No, you would not guess, from his way of writing,\\nthat he had ever thought of this Miss (what's her name?) for himself.\\nHe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is\\nnothing very unforgiving in that, I think.\"\\n\\nAnne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to\\nconvey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.\\nShe therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet\\nattention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.\\n\\n\"Poor Frederick!\" said he at last.  \"Now he must begin all over again\\nwith somebody else.  I think we must get him to Bath.  Sophy must\\nwrite, and beg him to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I am\\nsure.  It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other\\nMiss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.  Do\\nnot you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\n\\nWhile Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing his\\nwish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth was\\nalready on his way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written, he was\\narrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.\\n\\nMr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.  They were in\\nMilsom Street.  It began to rain, not much, but enough to make shelter\\ndesirable for women, and quite enough to make it very desirable for\\nMiss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady\\nDalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting at a little distance; she,\\nAnne, and Mrs Clay, therefore, turned into Molland's, while Mr Elliot\\nstepped to Lady Dalrymple, to request her assistance.  He soon joined\\nthem again, successful, of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy\\nto take them home, and would call for them in a few minutes.\\n\\nHer ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold more than four\\nwith any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her mother; consequently it\\nwas not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden\\nPlace ladies.  There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot.  Whoever\\nsuffered inconvenience, she must suffer none, but it occupied a little\\ntime to settle the point of civility between the other two.  The rain\\nwas a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with\\nMr Elliot.  But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would\\nhardly allow it even to drop at all, and her boots were so thick! much\\nthicker than Miss Anne's; and, in short, her civility rendered her\\nquite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be,\\nand it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so\\ndetermined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; Miss\\nElliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already, and Mr\\nElliot deciding on appeal, that his cousin Anne's boots were rather the\\nthickest.\\n\\nIt was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the\\ncarriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne, as she sat\\nnear the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly, Captain\\nWentworth walking down the street.\\n\\nHer start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable and\\nabsurd!  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her; it was all\\nconfusion.  She was lost, and when she had scolded back her senses, she\\nfound the others still waiting for the carriage, and Mr Elliot (always\\nobliging) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs\\nClay's.\\n\\nShe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door; she wanted to\\nsee if it rained.  Why was she to suspect herself of another motive?\\nCaptain Wentworth must be out of sight.  She left her seat, she would\\ngo; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other\\nhalf, or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was.  She\\nwould see if it rained.  She was sent back, however, in a moment by the\\nentrance of Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and\\nladies, evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined a\\nlittle below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck and confused\\nby the sight of her than she had ever observed before; he looked quite\\nred.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she felt\\nthat she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.  She had the\\nadvantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.  All the\\noverpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects of strong surprise\\nwere over with her.  Still, however, she had enough to feel!  It was\\nagitation, pain, pleasure, a something between delight and misery.\\n\\nHe spoke to her, and then turned away.  The character of his manner was\\nembarrassment.  She could not have called it either cold or friendly,\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed.\\n\\nAfter a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.\\nMutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible\\nof his being less at ease than formerly.  They had by dint of being so\\nvery much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it\\nnow.  Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.  There was\\nconsciousness of some sort or other.  He looked very well, not as if he\\nhad been suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,\\nof the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look of\\nhis own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was Captain\\nWentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.\\n\\nIt did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth\\nwould not know him.  She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw\\nhim, that there was complete internal recognition on each side; she was\\nconvinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,\\nexpecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with\\nunalterable coldness.\\n\\nLady Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing very\\nimpatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.  It was\\nbeginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay, and a\\nbustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd in the shop\\nunderstand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot.  At\\nlast Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but by the servant, (for\\nthere was no cousin returned), were walking off; and Captain Wentworth,\\nwatching them, turned again to Anne, and by manner, rather than words,\\nwas offering his services to her.\\n\\n\"I am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but I am not going with\\nthem.  The carriage would not accommodate so many.  I walk:  I prefer\\nwalking.\"\\n\\n\"But it rains.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment's pause he said:  \"Though I came only yesterday, I have\\nequipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,\" (pointing to a new\\numbrella); \"I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to\\nwalk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a\\nchair.\"\\n\\nShe was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating her\\nconviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present, and adding,\\n\"I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.  He will be here in a moment, I am\\nsure.\"\\n\\nShe had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.  Captain\\nWentworth recollected him perfectly.  There was no difference between\\nhim and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme, admiring Anne as\\nshe passed, except in the air and look and manner of the privileged\\nrelation and friend.  He came in with eagerness, appeared to see and\\nthink only of her, apologised for his stay, was grieved to have kept\\nher waiting, and anxious to get her away without further loss of time\\nand before the rain increased; and in another moment they walked off\\ntogether, her arm under his, a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a\\n\"Good morning to you!\" being all that she had time for, as she passed\\naway.\\n\\nAs soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's\\nparty began talking of them.\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there.\\nHe is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.  What a\\nvery good-looking man!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises, says\\nhe is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.\"\\n\\n\"She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes to\\nlook at her.  It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess I admire\\nher more than her sister.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! so do I.\"\\n\\n\"And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss\\nElliot.  Anne is too delicate for them.\"\\n\\nAnne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would\\nhave walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a\\nword.  She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though\\nnothing could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting: praise,\\nwarm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell, and insinuations\\nhighly rational against Mrs Clay.  But just now she could think only of\\nCaptain Wentworth.  She could not understand his present feelings,\\nwhether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not; and\\ntill that point were settled, she could not be quite herself.\\n\\nShe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!  she must\\nconfess to herself that she was not wise yet.\\n\\nAnother circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long he\\nmeant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not\\nrecollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was more\\nprobable that he should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as\\nevery body was to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all\\nlikelihood see him somewhere.  Would she recollect him?  How would it\\nall be?\\n\\nShe had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove\\nwas to marry Captain Benwick.  It had cost her something to encounter\\nLady Russell's surprise; and now, if she were by any chance to be\\nthrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge of\\nthe matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.\\n\\nThe following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first\\nhour, in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at\\nlast, in returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him on the\\nright hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the\\ngreater part of the street.  There were many other men about him, many\\ngroups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.  She\\nlooked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea of her\\nrecognising him so soon as she did herself.  No, it was not to be\\nsupposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly\\nopposite.  She looked at her however, from time to time, anxiously; and\\nwhen the moment approached which must point him out, though not daring\\nto look again (for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen),\\nshe was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell's eyes being turned\\nexactly in the direction for him--of her being, in short, intently\\nobserving him.  She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination\\nhe must possess over Lady Russell's mind, the difficulty it must be for\\nher to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment she must be feeling that\\neight or nine years should have passed over him, and in foreign climes\\nand in active service too, without robbing him of one personal grace!\\n\\nAt last, Lady Russell drew back her head.  \"Now, how would she speak of\\nhim?\"\\n\\n\"You will wonder,\" said she, \"what has been fixing my eye so long; but\\nI was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs\\nFrankland were telling me of last night.  They described the\\ndrawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the\\nway, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hung\\nof any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I have\\nbeen trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see no\\ncurtains hereabouts that answer their description.\"\\n\\nAnne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at her\\nfriend or herself.  The part which provoked her most, was that in all\\nthis waste of foresight and caution, she should have lost the right\\nmoment for seeing whether he saw them.\\n\\nA day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the\\nrooms, where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for\\nthe Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant\\nstupidity of private parties, in which they were getting more and more\\nengaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of\\nknowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her strength was\\nnot tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.  It was a\\nconcert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.  Of\\ncourse they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one, and\\nCaptain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she could only have a few\\nminutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should be\\nsatisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred.  Elizabeth had turned from him,\\nLady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened by these\\ncircumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.\\n\\nShe had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off, with\\nthe more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.  Mrs Smith\\ngave a most good-humoured acquiescence.\\n\\n\"By all means,\" said she; \"only tell me all about it, when you do come.\\nWho is your party?\"\\n\\nAnne named them all.  Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was leaving\\nher said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, \"Well, I\\nheartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if\\nyou can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many\\nmore visits from you.\"\\n\\nAnne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment's\\nsuspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\n\\nSir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest of all\\ntheir party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple must be\\nwaited for, they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon\\nRoom.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and\\nCaptain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was the nearest to him, and\\nmaking yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.  He was preparing\\nonly to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"How do you do?\" brought him\\nout of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries in\\nreturn, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back\\nground.  Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew\\nnothing of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed\\nright to be done.\\n\\nWhile they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth\\ncaught her ear.  She could not distinguish, but she must guess the\\nsubject; and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she\\ncomprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time by a\\nside glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.  This,\\nthough late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet better than\\nnothing, and her spirits improved.\\n\\nAfter talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,\\ntheir conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last, that\\nshe was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not; he seemed in\\nno hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit, with a little\\nsmile, a little glow, he said--\\n\\n\"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you must\\nhave suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering\\nyou at the time.\"\\n\\nShe assured him that she had not.\\n\\n\"It was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he passed\\nhis hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still too painful,\\nbut in a moment, half smiling again, added, \"The day has produced some\\neffects however; has had some consequences which must be considered as\\nthe very reverse of frightful.  When you had the presence of mind to\\nsuggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon,\\nyou could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most\\nconcerned in her recovery.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would\\nbe a very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles and\\ngood temper.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \"but there, I think, ends\\nthe resemblance.  With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice over\\nevery circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties to\\ncontend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.  The\\nMusgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's\\ncomfort.  All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;\\nmore than perhaps--\"\\n\\nHe stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne's cheeks and fixing\\nher eyes on the ground.  After clearing his throat, however, he\\nproceeded thus--\\n\\n\"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,\\nand in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove\\nas a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in\\nunderstanding, but Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, a\\nreading man; and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to\\nher with some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he\\nlearnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, it\\nwould have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.\\nIt seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,\\nuntaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  A man like him,\\nin his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!  Fanny\\nHarville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her was\\nindeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such a devotion of the\\nheart to such a woman.  He ought not; he does not.\"\\n\\nEither from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,\\nor from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who, in spite\\nof the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered, and in\\nspite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless slam\\nof the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through, had\\ndistinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused, and\\nbeginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things in a\\nmoment.  It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject; and yet,\\nafter a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking, and having not the\\nsmallest wish for a total change, she only deviated so far as to say--\\n\\n\"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?\"\\n\\n\"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well was\\nquite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to\\nbe soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.  She would not\\nhave been obstinate if I had not been weak.  The country round Lyme is\\nvery fine.  I walked and rode a great deal; and the more I saw, the\\nmore I found to admire.\"\\n\\n\"I should very much like to see Lyme again,\" said Anne.\\n\\n\"Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found anything\\nin Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress you were\\ninvolved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!  I should have\\nthought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust.\"\\n\\n\"The last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied Anne; \"but when\\npain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.  One does\\nnot love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been\\nall suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at\\nLyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours,\\nand previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment.  So much\\nnovelty and beauty! I have travelled so little, that every fresh place\\nwould be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and in\\nshort\" (with a faint blush at some recollections), \"altogether my\\nimpressions of the place are very agreeable.\"\\n\\nAs she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party\\nappeared for whom they were waiting.  \"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\"\\nwas the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible with\\nanxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet\\nher.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot and\\nColonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,\\nadvanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was a group in\\nwhich Anne found herself also necessarily included.  She was divided\\nfrom Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting, almost too interesting\\nconversation must be broken up for a time, but slight was the penance\\ncompared with the happiness which brought it on!  She had learnt, in\\nthe last ten minutes, more of his feelings towards Louisa, more of all\\nhis feelings than she dared to think of; and she gave herself up to the\\ndemands of the party, to the needful civilities of the moment, with\\nexquisite, though agitated sensations.  She was in good humour with\\nall.  She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and\\nkind to all, and to pity every one, as being less happy than herself.\\n\\nThe delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back\\nfrom the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw that\\nhe was gone.  She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert\\nRoom.  He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt a moment's regret.\\nBut \"they should meet again.  He would look for her, he would find her\\nout before the evening were over, and at present, perhaps, it was as\\nwell to be asunder.  She was in need of a little interval for\\nrecollection.\"\\n\\nUpon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party was\\ncollected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceed\\ninto the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power,\\ndraw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many people\\nas they could.\\n\\nVery, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.\\nElizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back\\nof the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish\\nfor which did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be an\\ninsult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison between\\nit and her sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity, of the other\\nall generous attachment.\\n\\nAnne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.  Her\\nhappiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;\\nbut she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of the last half\\nhour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took a hasty range\\nover it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions, and still more his\\nmanner and look, had been such as she could see in only one light.  His\\nopinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority, an opinion which he had\\nseemed solicitous to give, his wonder at Captain Benwick, his feelings\\nas to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which he could not\\nfinish, his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance,\\nall, all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least; that\\nanger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they were\\nsucceeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tenderness\\nof the past.  Yes, some share of the tenderness of the past.  She could\\nnot contemplate the change as implying less.  He must love her.\\n\\nThese were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied and\\nflurried her too much to leave her any power of observation; and she\\npassed along the room without having a glimpse of him, without even\\ntrying to discern him.  When their places were determined on, and they\\nwere all properly arranged, she looked round to see if he should happen\\nto be in the same part of the room, but he was not; her eye could not\\nreach him; and the concert being just opening, she must consent for a\\ntime to be happy in a humbler way.\\n\\nThe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches: Anne\\nwas among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,\\nwith the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by\\nher.  Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object\\nof Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented.\\n\\nAnne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the\\nevening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for the\\ntender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience\\nfor the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least\\nduring the first act.  Towards the close of it, in the interval\\nsucceeding an Italian song, she explained the words of the song to Mr\\nElliot.  They had a concert bill between them.\\n\\n\"This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the\\nwords, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be\\ntalked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not\\npretend to understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.  You\\nhave only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these\\ninverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,\\ncomprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more of\\nyour ignorance.  Here is complete proof.\"\\n\\n\"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be\\nexamined by a real proficient.\"\\n\\n\"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,\"\\nreplied he, \"without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot; and I do\\nregard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be\\naware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished for\\nmodesty to be natural in any other woman.\"\\n\\n\"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are\\nto have next,\" turning to the bill.\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mr Elliot, speaking low, \"I have had a longer\\nacquaintance with your character than you are aware of.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since I\\ncame to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my\\nown family.\"\\n\\n\"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard you\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted\\nwith you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,\\naccomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"\\n\\nMr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.  No\\none can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been described\\nlong ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible;\\nand Anne was all curiosity.  She wondered, and questioned him eagerly;\\nbut in vain.  He delighted in being asked, but he would not tell.\\n\\n\"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  He would mention no\\nnames now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.  He had\\nmany years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had\\ninspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited the\\nwarmest curiosity to know her.\"\\n\\nAnne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of\\nher many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth's\\nbrother.  He might have been in Mr Elliot's company, but she had not\\ncourage to ask the question.\\n\\n\"The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound\\nto me.  Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I\\ndared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"\\n\\nSuch, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she received their\\nsound, than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind\\nher, which rendered every thing else trivial.  Her father and Lady\\nDalrymple were speaking.\\n\\n\"A well-looking man,\" said Sir Walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"\\n\\n\"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple.  \"More air than\\none often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth; Captain\\nWentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire,\\nthe Croft, who rents Kellynch.\"\\n\\nBefore Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught the\\nright direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a\\ncluster of men at a little distance.  As her eyes fell on him, his\\nseemed to be withdrawn from her.  It had that appearance.  It seemed as\\nif she had been one moment too late; and as long as she dared observe,\\nhe did not look again:  but the performance was recommencing, and she\\nwas forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look\\nstraight forward.\\n\\nWhen she could give another glance, he had moved away.  He could not\\nhave come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye.\\n\\nMr Elliot's speech, too, distressed her.  She had no longer any\\ninclination to talk to him.  She wished him not so near her.\\n\\nThe first act was over.  Now she hoped for some beneficial change; and,\\nafter a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them did\\ndecide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who did not\\nchoose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell; but\\nshe had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,\\nwhatever she might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from\\nconversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.\\nShe was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she had seen him.\\n\\nHe did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a\\ndistance, but he never came.  The anxious interval wore away\\nunproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again, benches\\nwere reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure or of\\npenance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give delight or\\nthe gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.  To Anne, it\\nchiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.  She could not quit\\nthat room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more, without\\nthe interchange of one friendly look.\\n\\nIn re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of\\nwhich was favourable for her.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down\\nagain, and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a\\nmanner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other\\nremovals, and a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to place\\nherself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before, much\\nmore within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so, without\\ncomparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but\\nstill she did it, and not with much happier effect; though by what\\nseemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next\\nneighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench before the\\nconcert closed.\\n\\nSuch was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain\\nWentworth was again in sight.  She saw him not far off.  He saw her\\ntoo; yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow\\ndegrees came at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt that\\nsomething must be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The\\ndifference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon\\nRoom was strikingly great.  Why was it?  She thought of her father, of\\nLady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?  He began\\nby speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of\\nUppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and in\\nshort, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.  Anne\\nreplied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet in\\nallowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\\nimproved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked for a\\nfew minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down towards the\\nbench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that\\nmoment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.  It came\\nfrom Mr Elliot.  He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to, to\\nexplain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a\\ngeneral idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse; but\\nnever had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.\\n\\nA few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; and\\nwhen her own mistress again, when able to turn and look as she had done\\nbefore, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a reserved\\nyet hurried sort of farewell.  \"He must wish her good night; he was\\ngoing; he should get home as fast as he could.\"\\n\\n\"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck by an\\nidea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.\\n\\n\"No!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"\\nand he was gone directly.\\n\\nJealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.  Captain\\nWentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it a week\\nago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.\\nBut, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.  How was such\\njealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?  How, in all\\nthe peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations, would he\\never learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think of Mr\\nElliot's attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\n\\nAnne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to\\nMrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when\\nMr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid Mr Elliot was\\nalmost a first object.\\n\\nShe felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of the\\nmischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard, perhaps\\ncompassion.  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which he\\nseemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation, by his own\\nsentiments, by his early prepossession.  It was altogether very\\nextraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.  How\\nshe might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,\\nwas not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the\\nconclusion of the present suspense good or bad, her affection would be\\nhis for ever.  Their union, she believed, could not divide her more\\nfrom other men, than their final separation.\\n\\nPrettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy, could\\nnever have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne was sporting\\nwith from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.  It was almost enough to\\nspread purification and perfume all the way.\\n\\nShe was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this\\nmorning particularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have\\nexpected her, though it had been an appointment.\\n\\nAn account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne's\\nrecollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her\\nfeatures and make her rejoice to talk of it.  All that she could tell\\nshe told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been\\nthere, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had\\nalready heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne\\ncould relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the\\ncompany.  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well\\nknow by name to Mrs Smith.\\n\\n\"The little Durands were there, I conclude,\" said she, \"with their\\nmouths open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be\\nfed.  They never miss a concert.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in\\nthe room.\"\\n\\n\"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties, with the\\ntall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.  I do not think they were.\"\\n\\n\"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.  She never misses, I\\nknow; and you must have seen her.  She must have been in your own\\ncircle; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of\\ngrandeur, round the orchestra, of course.\"\\n\\n\"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me\\nin every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be\\nfarther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, for hearing;\\nI must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen very little.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.  There\\nis a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and this\\nyou had.  You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing\\nbeyond.\"\\n\\n\"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious while\\nshe spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, that\\nthe object only had been deficient.\\n\\n\"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you had a\\npleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see how the hours\\npassed:  that you had always something agreeable to listen to.  In the\\nintervals of the concert it was conversation.\"\\n\\nAnne half smiled and said, \"Do you see that in my eye?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in\\ncompany last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in\\nthe world, the person who interests you at this present time more than\\nall the rest of the world put together.\"\\n\\nA blush overspread Anne's cheeks.  She could say nothing.\\n\\n\"And such being the case,\" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause, \"I\\nhope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to\\nme this morning.  It is really very good of you to come and sit with\\nme, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time.\"\\n\\nAnne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment and\\nconfusion excited by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine how\\nany report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.  After another\\nshort silence--\\n\\n\"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with\\nme?  Does he know that I am in Bath?\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot!\" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment's\\nreflection shewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught it\\ninstantaneously; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety,\\nsoon added, more composedly, \"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?\"\\n\\n\"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied Mrs Smith,\\ngravely, \"but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met.\"\\n\\n\"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.  Had I\\nknown it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\"\\n\\n\"To confess the truth,\" said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual air of\\ncheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.  I want\\nyou to talk about me to Mr Elliot.  I want your interest with him.  He\\ncan be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,\\nmy dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself, of course it is\\ndone.\"\\n\\n\"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to\\nbe of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect that\\nyou are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot, a greater\\nright to influence him, than is really the case.  I am sure you have,\\nsomehow or other, imbibed such a notion.  You must consider me only as\\nMr Elliot's relation.  If in that light there is anything which you\\nsuppose his cousin might fairly ask of him, I beg you would not\\nhesitate to employ me.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--\\n\\n\"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.  I\\nought to have waited for official information.  But now, my dear Miss\\nElliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.\\nNext week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all\\nsettled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot's good fortune.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.  I assure you\\nthat nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week.\\nI am not going to marry Mr Elliot.  I should like to know why you\\nimagine I am?\"\\n\\nMrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled, shook her\\nhead, and exclaimed--\\n\\n\"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew what you\\nwere at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, when\\nthe right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know, we women never\\nmean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us, that every man\\nis refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?  Let me plead\\nfor my--present friend I cannot call him, but for my former friend.\\nWhere can you look for a more suitable match?  Where could you expect a\\nmore gentlemanlike, agreeable man?  Let me recommend Mr Elliot.  I am\\nsure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis; and who can\\nknow him better than Colonel Wallis?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above half\\na year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any\\none.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried Mrs Smith, archly, \"Mr\\nElliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.  Do\\nnot forget me when you are married, that's all.  Let him know me to be\\na friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble\\nrequired, which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs\\nand engagements of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very\\nnatural, perhaps.  Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of\\ncourse, he cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss\\nElliot, I hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has sense\\nto understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be\\nshipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters, and\\nsafe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not be\\nmisled by others to his ruin.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Anne, \"I can readily believe all that of my cousin.  He\\nseems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerous\\nimpressions.  I consider him with great respect.  I have no reason,\\nfrom any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise.\\nBut I have not known him long; and he is not a man, I think, to be\\nknown intimately soon.  Will not this manner of speaking of him, Mrs\\nSmith, convince you that he is nothing to me?  Surely this must be calm\\nenough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.  Should he ever\\npropose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine he has any\\nthought of doing), I shall not accept him.  I assure you I shall not.\\nI assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been\\nsupposing, in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford:\\nnot Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--\"\\n\\nShe stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardly\\nhave believed so soon in Mr Elliot's failure, but from the perception\\nof there being a somebody else.  As it was, she instantly submitted,\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager to\\nescape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have\\nfancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have received the\\nidea, or from whom she could have heard it.\\n\\n\"Do tell me how it first came into your head.\"\\n\\n\"It first came into my head,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"upon finding how much\\nyou were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the\\nworld to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you\\nmay depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in\\nthe same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\"\\n\\n\"And has it indeed been spoken of?\"\\n\\n\"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called\\nyesterday?\"\\n\\n\"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed no one\\nin particular.\"\\n\\n\"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye, had a great\\ncuriosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in.\\nShe came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday; and she it was\\nwho told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.  She had had it from Mrs\\nWallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.  She sat an hour with\\nme on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\" \"The whole\\nhistory,\" repeated Anne, laughing.  \"She could not make a very long\\nhistory, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith said nothing.\\n\\n\"But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my\\nhaving this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of\\nuse to you in any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your being\\nin Bath?  Shall I take any message?\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment, and\\nunder a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured to\\ninterest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you, I\\nhave nothing to trouble you with.\"\\n\\n\"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?\"\\n\\n\"I did.\"\\n\\n\"Not before he was married, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.\"\\n\\n\"And--were you much acquainted?\"\\n\\n\"Intimately.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.  I have a\\ngreat curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.  Was he\\nat all such as he appears now?\"\\n\\n\"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith's answer,\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;\\nand Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.\\nThey were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,\" she cried, in her natural\\ntone of cordiality, \"I beg your pardon for the short answers I have\\nbeen giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.  I have\\nbeen doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.  There\\nwere many things to be taken into the account.  One hates to be\\nofficious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.  Even the\\nsmooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving, though there may\\nbe nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined; I think I am\\nright; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot's real\\ncharacter.  Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not the\\nsmallest intention of accepting him, there is no saying what may\\nhappen.  You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards\\nhim.  Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr\\nElliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary,\\ncold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own\\ninterest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery,\\nthat could be perpetrated without risk of his general character.  He\\nhas no feeling for others.  Those whom he has been the chief cause of\\nleading into ruin, he can neglect and desert without the smallest\\ncompunction.  He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of\\njustice or compassion.  Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"\\n\\nAnne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause, and\\nin a calmer manner, she added,\\n\\n\"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry\\nwoman.  But I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him.  I\\nwill only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak.  He was\\nthe intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and\\nthought him as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed before\\nour marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became\\nexcessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest opinion\\nof him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but\\nMr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and much more\\nagreeable than most others, and we were almost always together.  We\\nwere principally in town, living in very good style.  He was then the\\ninferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in\\nthe Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance\\nof a gentleman.  He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he\\nwas always welcome; he was like a brother.  My poor Charles, who had\\nthe finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided his\\nlast farthing with him; and I know that his purse was open to him; I\\nknow that he often assisted him.\"\\n\\n\"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life,\" said\\nAnne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.  It must have\\nbeen about the same time that he became known to my father and sister.\\nI never knew him myself; I only heard of him; but there was a something\\nin his conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and\\nafterwards in the circumstances of his marriage, which I never could\\nquite reconcile with present times.  It seemed to announce a different\\nsort of man.\"\\n\\n\"I know it all, I know it all,\" cried Mrs Smith.  \"He had been\\nintroduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with\\nhim, but I heard him speak of them for ever.  I know he was invited and\\nencouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,\\nperhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his\\nmarriage, I knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the fors\\nand againsts; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans;\\nand though I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation\\nin society, indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her\\nlife afterwards, or at least till within the last two years of her\\nlife, and can answer any question you may wish to put.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said Anne, \"I have no particular enquiry to make about her.  I\\nhave always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should like\\nto know why, at that time of his life, he should slight my father's\\nacquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed to take very\\nkind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?\"\\n\\n\"Mr Elliot,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"at that period of his life, had one\\nobject in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker process\\nthan the law.  He was determined to make it by marriage.  He was\\ndetermined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and I\\nknow it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course I cannot\\ndecide), that your father and sister, in their civilities and\\ninvitations, were designing a match between the heir and the young\\nlady, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his\\nideas of wealth and independence.  That was his motive for drawing\\nback, I can assure you.  He told me the whole story.  He had no\\nconcealments with me.  It was curious, that having just left you behind\\nme in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be\\nyour cousin; and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of\\nyour father and sister.  He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought\\nvery affectionately of the other.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes spoke of\\nme to Mr Elliot?\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"\\n\\nShe checked herself just in time.\\n\\n\"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,\" cried\\nAnne.  \"This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me.  I\\ncould not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where dear\\nself is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon; I\\nhave interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?\\nThe circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes to his\\ncharacter.\"\\n\\nMrs Smith hesitated a little here.  \"Oh! those things are too common.\\nWhen one lives in the world, a man or woman's marrying for money is too\\ncommon to strike one as it ought.  I was very young, and associated\\nonly with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without any\\nstrict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.  I think differently\\nnow; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but at\\nthat period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot\\nwas doing.  'To do the best for himself,' passed as a duty.\"\\n\\n\"But was not she a very low woman?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.  Money, money, was\\nall that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather had been\\na butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman, had had a\\ndecent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance\\ninto Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him; and not a\\ndifficulty or a scruple was there on his side, with respect to her\\nbirth.  All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount\\nof her fortune, before he committed himself.  Depend upon it, whatever\\nesteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a young\\nman he had not the smallest value for it.  His chance for the Kellynch\\nestate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheap\\nas dirt.  I have often heard him declare, that if baronetcies were\\nsaleable, anybody should have his for fifty pounds, arms and motto,\\nname and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I\\nused to hear him say on that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet\\nyou ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and you\\nshall have proof.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,\" cried Anne.  \"You have\\nasserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some\\nyears ago.  This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to\\nhear and believe.  I am more curious to know why he should be so\\ndifferent now.\"\\n\\n\"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for\\nMary; stay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"\\n\\nAnne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was\\ndesired.  The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith,\\nsighing over it as she unlocked it, said--\\n\\n\"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband; a small\\nportion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.  The letter I\\nam looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage,\\nand happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.  But he was\\ncareless and immethodical, like other men, about those things; and when\\nI came to examine his papers, I found it with others still more\\ntrivial, from different people scattered here and there, while many\\nletters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.  Here it\\nis; I would not burn it, because being even then very little satisfied\\nwith Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document of former\\nintimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce\\nit.\"\\n\\nThis was the letter, directed to \"Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,\"\\nand dated from London, as far back as July, 1803:--\\n\\n\"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers\\nme.  I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I\\nhave lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like\\nit.  At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being in\\ncash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.  They\\nare gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them this\\nsummer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tell\\nme how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.  The baronet,\\nnevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he is quite fool enough.\\nIf he does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent\\nequivalent  for the reversion.  He is worse than last year.\\n\\n\"I wish I had any name but Elliot.  I am sick of it.  The name of\\nWalter I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me\\nwith my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be only\\nyours truly,--Wm. Elliot.\"\\n\\nSuch a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow; and Mrs\\nSmith, observing the high colour in her face, said--\\n\\n\"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot\\nthe exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.\\nBut it shows you the man.  Mark his professions to my poor husband.\\nCan any thing be stronger?\"\\n\\nAnne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of\\nfinding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollect\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour, that\\nno one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies, that no\\nprivate correspondence could bear the eye of others, before she could\\nrecover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been\\nmeditating over, and say--\\n\\n\"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing you\\nwere saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?\"\\n\\n\"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling.\\n\\n\"Can you really?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago, and I\\nwill shew him as he is now.  I cannot produce written proof again, but\\nI can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he is\\nnow wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now.  He\\ntruly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family are\\nvery sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority: his\\nfriend Colonel Wallis.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"\\n\\n\"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; it\\ntakes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream is as good\\nas at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily\\nmoved away.  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his\\nviews on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in himself, a\\nsensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Wallis has\\na very pretty silly wife, to whom he tells things which he had better\\nnot, and he repeats it all to her.  She in the overflowing spirits of\\nher recovery, repeats it all to her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my\\nacquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday\\nevening, my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of\\nMarlborough Buildings.  When I talked of a whole history, therefore,\\nyou see I was not romancing so much as you supposed.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.  Mr\\nElliot's having any views on me will not in the least account for the\\nefforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.  That was all\\nprior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on the most friendly terms\\nwhen I arrived.\"\\n\\n\"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information in such\\na line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so\\nmany, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can\\nhardly have much truth left.\"\\n\\n\"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of the general\\ncredit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself\\nimmediately contradict or confirm.  Nobody supposes that you were his\\nfirst inducement.  He had seen you indeed, before he came to Bath, and\\nadmired you, but without knowing it to be you.  So says my historian,\\nat least.  Is this true?  Did he see you last summer or autumn,\\n'somewhere down in the west,' to use her own words, without knowing it\\nto be you?\"\\n\\n\"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.  I happened to be\\nat Lyme.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then\\nat Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet\\nwith you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that\\nmoment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there.  But\\nthere was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain.  If there\\nis anything in my story which you know to be either false or\\nimprobable, stop me.  My account states, that your sister's friend, the\\nlady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath\\nwith Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when\\nthey first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since;\\nthat she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible,\\nand altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea,\\namong Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and\\nas general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to\\nthe danger.\"\\n\\nHere Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say, and she\\ncontinued--\\n\\n\"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,\\nlong before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon\\nyour father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit\\nin Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in\\nwatching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath\\nfor a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,\\nColonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things, and\\nthe reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand, that time\\nhad worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions as to the\\nvalue of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a\\ncompletely altered man.  Having long had as much money as he could\\nspend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has\\nbeen gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is\\nheir to.  I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it\\nis now a confirmed feeling.  He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir\\nWilliam.  You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his\\nfriend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced;\\nthe resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of\\nfixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former\\nacquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give\\nhim the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of\\ncircumventing the lady if he found it material.  This was agreed upon\\nbetween the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel\\nWallis was to assist in every way that he could.  He was to be\\nintroduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to\\nbe introduced.  Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was\\nforgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it\\nwas his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added\\nanother motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.  He omitted no\\nopportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at\\nall hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.  You can\\nimagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may\\nrecollect what you have seen him do.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with what\\nI have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive in\\nthe details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\nmust ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises\\nme.  I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr\\nElliot, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never\\nbeen satisfied.  I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct\\nthan appeared.  I should like to know his present opinion, as to the\\nprobability of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers\\nthe danger to be lessening or not.\"\\n\\n\"Lessening, I understand,\" replied Mrs Smith.  \"He thinks Mrs Clay\\nafraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to\\nproceed as she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absent\\nsome time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while\\nshe holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as\\nnurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when\\nyou and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.  A\\nscheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts; but my\\nsensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  'Why, to be sure,\\nma'am,' said she, 'it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.'\\nAnd, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a\\nvery strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.  She must\\nbe allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since self\\nwill intrude) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of\\nattending the next Lady Elliot, through Mrs Wallis's recommendation?\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad to know all this,\" said Anne, after a little\\nthoughtfulness.  \"It will be more painful to me in some respects to be\\nin company with him, but I shall know better what to do.  My line of\\nconduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous,\\nartificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle to\\nguide him than selfishness.\"\\n\\nBut Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away from\\nher first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest of her own\\nfamily concerns, how much had been originally implied against him; but\\nher attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints,\\nand she listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify\\nthe unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith, proved him to have been very\\nunfeeling in his conduct towards her; very deficient both in justice\\nand compassion.\\n\\nShe learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr\\nElliot's marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr\\nElliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.  Mrs\\nSmith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender of\\nthrowing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income\\nhad never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.  From\\nhis wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man\\nof warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong\\nunderstanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,\\nled by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by his\\nmarriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of\\npleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,\\n(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man), and\\nbeginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself to\\nbe poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's\\nprobable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths\\naccordingly had been ruined.\\n\\nThe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of\\nit.  They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the\\nfriendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better\\nnot be tried; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of\\nhis affairs was fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard,\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had\\nappointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been\\nsuch as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to\\nwithout corresponding indignation.\\n\\nAnne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to urgent\\napplications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same stern\\nresolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold\\ncivility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it\\nmight bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and\\ninhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime\\ncould have been worse.  She had a great deal to listen to; all the\\nparticulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon\\ndistress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were\\ndwelt on now with a natural indulgence.  Anne could perfectly\\ncomprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to\\nwonder at the composure of her friend's usual state of mind.\\n\\nThere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of\\nparticular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that some\\nproperty of her husband in the West Indies, which had been for many\\nyears under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own\\nincumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and this\\nproperty, though not large, would be enough to make her comparatively\\nrich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.  Mr Elliot would do nothing,\\nand she could do nothing herself, equally disabled from personal\\nexertion by her state of bodily weakness, and from employing others by\\nher want of money.  She had no natural connexions to assist her even\\nwith their counsel, and she could not afford to purchase the assistance\\nof the law.  This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.\\nTo feel that she ought to be in better circumstances, that a little\\ntrouble in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be\\neven weakening her claims, was hard to bear.\\n\\nIt was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good offices\\nwith Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation of their\\nmarriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it; but on\\nbeing assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature, since\\nhe did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that\\nsomething might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he\\nloved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings,\\nas far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow,\\nwhen Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of\\neverything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of\\nsucceeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least the\\ncomfort of telling the whole story her own way.\\n\\nAfter listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not\\nbut express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him so\\nfavourably in the beginning of their conversation.  \"She had seemed to\\nrecommend and praise him!\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" was Mrs Smith's reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.\\nI considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet have\\nmade the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if he\\nhad been your husband.  My heart bled for you, as I talked of\\nhappiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such a\\nwoman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.  He was very unkind to\\nhis first wife.  They were wretched together.  But she was too ignorant\\nand giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.  I was willing to\\nhope that you must fare better.\"\\n\\nAnne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having\\nbeen induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea of the\\nmisery which must have followed.  It was just possible that she might\\nhave been persuaded by Lady Russell!  And under such a supposition,\\nwhich would have been most miserable, when time had disclosed all, too\\nlate?\\n\\nIt was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning, was, that\\nAnne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative\\nto Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\n\\nAnne went home to think over all that she had heard.  In one point, her\\nfeelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.  There was no\\nlonger anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as opposed to\\nCaptain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness; and the evil\\nof his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief he might have\\ndone, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.  Pity\\nfor him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.  In every\\nother respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward, she saw\\nmore to distrust and to apprehend.  She was concerned for the\\ndisappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling; for the\\nmortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister, and\\nhad all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how to\\navert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own knowledge of\\nhim.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not\\nslighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was a reward indeed\\nspringing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one\\nelse could have done.  Could the knowledge have been extended through\\nher family?  But this was a vain idea.  She must talk to Lady Russell,\\ntell her, consult with her, and having done her best, wait the event\\nwith as much composure as possible; and after all, her greatest want of\\ncomposure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be\\nopened to Lady Russell; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must\\nbe all to herself.\\n\\n\\nShe found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended, escaped\\nseeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them a long morning\\nvisit; but hardly had she congratulated herself, and felt safe, when\\nshe heard that he was coming again in the evening.\\n\\n\"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth, with\\naffected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints; so Mrs Clay says, at\\nleast.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for\\nan invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him; for your\\nhard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I have been rather too much used to the game to\\nbe soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.  However, when I found how\\nexcessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this\\nmorning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an\\nopportunity of bringing him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to so\\nmuch advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so\\npleasantly.  Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect.\"\\n\\n\"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however, to turn her\\neyes towards Anne.  \"Exactly like father and son!  Dear Miss Elliot,\\nmay I not say father and son?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words.  If you will have such\\nideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\nbeing beyond those of other men.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Elliot!\" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.  I did\\ninvite him, you know.  I sent him away with smiles.  When I found he\\nwas really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day\\nto-morrow, I had compassion on him.\"\\n\\nAnne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such\\npleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of\\nthe very person whose presence must really be interfering with her\\nprime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight\\nof Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging, placid look,\\nand appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting\\nherself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done\\notherwise.\\n\\nTo Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the\\nroom; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.  She had\\nbeen used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere, but\\nnow she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference to her\\nfather, contrasted with his former language, was odious; and when she\\nthought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith, she could hardly bear\\nthe sight of his present smiles and mildness, or the sound of his\\nartificial good sentiments.\\n\\nShe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a\\nremonstrance on his side.  It was a great object to her to escape all\\nenquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to\\nhim as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, as\\nquietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\nbeen gradually led along.  She was accordingly more guarded, and more\\ncool, than she had been the night before.\\n\\nHe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could\\nhave heard her formerly praised; wanted very much to be gratified by\\nmore solicitation; but the charm was broken: he found that the heat and\\nanimation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin's\\nvanity; he found, at least, that it was not to be done now, by any of\\nthose attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims of\\nthe others.  He little surmised that it was a subject acting now\\nexactly against his interest, bringing immediately to her thoughts all\\nthose parts of his conduct which were least excusable.\\n\\nShe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of\\nBath the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the\\ngreater part of two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place the\\nvery evening of his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his\\nabsence was certain.  It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be\\nalways before her; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their\\nparty, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.  It\\nwas so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on\\nher father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources of\\nmortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay's selfishness was not so\\ncomplicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded for\\nthe marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot's\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\\n\\nOn Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell, and\\naccomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone\\ndirectly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some\\nobliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which determined her to\\nwait till she might be safe from such a companion.  She saw Mrs Clay\\nfairly off, therefore, before she began to talk of spending the morning\\nin Rivers Street.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have nothing to send but my love.  Oh!\\nyou may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me, and\\npretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself for\\never with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.\\nLady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.  You need not\\ntell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.  I used\\nto think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her at the\\nconcert.  Something so formal and _arrangÃ©_ in her air!  and she sits so\\nupright!  My best love, of course.\"\\n\\n\"And mine,\" added Sir Walter.  \"Kindest regards.  And you may say, that\\nI mean to call upon her soon.  Make a civil message; but I shall only\\nleave my card.  Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of\\nlife, who make themselves up so little.  If she would only wear rouge\\nshe would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I\\nobserved the blinds were let down immediately.\"\\n\\nWhile her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it\\nbe?  Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr\\nElliot, would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven\\nmiles off.  After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of\\napproach were heard, and \"Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove\" were ushered\\ninto the room.\\n\\nSurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance; but Anne\\nwas really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry but that\\nthey could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it became\\nclear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived with any\\nviews of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were\\nable to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.  They\\nwere come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were at the\\nWhite Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood; but till Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing-room, and\\nregaling themselves with her admiration, Anne could not draw upon\\nCharles's brain for a regular history of their coming, or an\\nexplanation of some smiling hints of particular business, which had\\nbeen ostentatiously dropped by Mary, as well as of some apparent\\nconfusion as to whom their party consisted of.\\n\\nShe then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta, and\\nCaptain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,\\nintelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw a great\\ndeal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme had received its\\nfirst impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to come to Bath on\\nbusiness.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago; and by way of doing\\nsomething, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed coming with him,\\nand Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much, as an\\nadvantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear to be left, and had\\nmade herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everything\\nseemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then, it had been taken up\\nby his father and mother.  His mother had some old friends in Bath whom\\nshe wanted to see; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to\\ncome and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her sister; and, in short,\\nit ended in being his mother's party, that everything might be\\ncomfortable and easy to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included\\nin it by way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night\\nbefore.  Mrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with\\nMr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.\\n\\nAnne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\nfor Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined such\\ndifficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage\\nfrom being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that, very\\nrecently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter had\\nbeen applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not\\npossibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of his\\npresent income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent\\nlong before the term in question, the two families had consented to the\\nyoung people's wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take place\\nin a few months, quite as soon as Louisa's.  \"And a very good living it\\nwas,\" Charles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and\\nin a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire.  In the centre of\\nsome of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great\\nproprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two\\nof the three at least, Charles Hayter might get a special\\nrecommendation.  Not that he will value it as he ought,\" he observed,\\n\"Charles is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of him.\"\\n\\n\"I am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried Anne, \"particularly glad that this\\nshould happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well,\\nand who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of\\none should not be dimming those of the other--that they should be so\\nequal in their prosperity and comfort.  I hope your father and mother\\nare quite happy with regard to both.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were\\nricher, but he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming\\ndown with money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable\\noperation, and it streightens him as to many things.  However, I do not\\nmean to say they have not a right to it.  It is very fit they should\\nhave daughters' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,\\nliberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta's match.\\nShe never did, you know.  But she does not do him justice, nor think\\nenough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her attend to the value of the\\nproperty.  It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked\\nCharles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\"\\n\\n\"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne,\\n\"should be happy in their children's marriages.  They do everything to\\nconfer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people to be in\\nsuch hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those\\nambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery,\\nboth in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered\\nnow?\"\\n\\nHe answered rather hesitatingly, \"Yes, I believe I do; very much\\nrecovered; but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no\\nlaughing or dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to\\nshut the door a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young\\ndab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses,\\nor whispering to her, all day long.\"\\n\\nAnne could not help laughing.  \"That cannot be much to your taste, I\\nknow,\" said she; \"but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure he is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am\\nso illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\npleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one\\ncan but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has done\\nhim no harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow.\\nI got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.  We\\nhad a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father's great\\nbarns; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better\\never since.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles's\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had heard\\nenough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice in\\nits happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced, her sigh had none\\nof the ill-will of envy in it.  She would certainly have risen to their\\nblessings if she could, but she did not want to lessen theirs.\\n\\nThe visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was in\\nexcellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so well\\nsatisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage with four\\nhorses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place, that\\nshe was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought, and\\nenter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as they\\nwere detailed to her.  She had no demands on her father or sister, and\\nher consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\ndrawing-rooms.\\n\\nElizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.  She felt that\\nMrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them; but\\nshe could not bear to have the difference of style, the reduction of\\nservants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those who had been\\nalways so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.  It was a struggle\\nbetween propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then\\nElizabeth was happy again.  These were her internal persuasions: \"Old\\nfashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give\\ndinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; did not even\\nask her own sister's family, though they were here a month: and I dare\\nsay it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove; put her quite out of\\nher way.  I am sure she would rather not come; she cannot feel easy\\nwith us.  I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better;\\nthat will be a novelty and a treat.  They have not seen two such\\ndrawing rooms before.  They will be delighted to come to-morrow\\nevening.  It shall be a regular party, small, but most elegant.\"  And\\nthis satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation was given to the two\\npresent, and promised for the absent, Mary was as completely satisfied.\\nShe was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady\\nDalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to\\ncome; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention.\\nMiss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the\\ncourse of the morning; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go\\nand see her and Henrietta directly.\\n\\nHer plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.\\nThey all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes; but\\nAnne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication\\ncould be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart, to\\nsee again the friends and companions of the last autumn, with an\\neagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\\n\\nThey found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves, and\\nAnne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly in that\\nstate of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made\\nher full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before\\nat all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won by her\\nusefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness, and a\\nwarmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more, from the sad\\nwant of such blessings at home.  She was entreated to give them as much\\nof her time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or\\nrather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she naturally\\nfell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on\\nCharles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's\\nhistory of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions on\\nbusiness, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help\\nwhich Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;\\nfrom finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying to\\nconvince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary, well\\namused as she generally was, in her station at a window overlooking the\\nentrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her moments of imagining.\\n\\nA morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party in\\nan hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes\\nbrought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half an\\nhour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half\\nfilled:  a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove,\\nand Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth.  The\\nappearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the\\nmoment.  It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this\\narrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together\\nagain.  Their last meeting had been most important in opening his\\nfeelings; she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she\\nfeared from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\\nhastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.  He did not\\nseem to want to be near enough for conversation.\\n\\nShe tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and tried\\nto dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--\"Surely, if\\nthere be constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understand\\neach other ere long.  We are not boy and girl, to be captiously\\nirritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence, and wantonly playing\\nwith our own happiness.\"  And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she felt\\nas if their being in company with each other, under their present\\ncircumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and\\nmisconstructions of the most mischievous kind.\\n\\n\"Anne,\" cried Mary, still at her window, \"there is Mrs Clay, I am sure,\\nstanding under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.  I saw them\\nturn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed deep in talk.\\nWho is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.  It is Mr\\nElliot himself.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.  He\\nwas to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her, the\\nconsciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret\\nthat she had said so much, simple as it was.\\n\\nMary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting\\nstill more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne to\\ncome and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir, and tried to\\nbe cool and unconcerned.  Her distress returned, however, on perceiving\\nsmiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady\\nvisitors, as if they believed themselves quite in the secret.  It was\\nevident that the report concerning her had spread, and a short pause\\nsucceeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther.\\n\\n\"Do come, Anne,\" cried Mary, \"come and look yourself.  You will be too\\nlate if you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking\\nhands.  He is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to\\nhave forgot all about Lyme.\"\\n\\nTo pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment, Anne did move\\nquietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain that it\\nreally was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed, before he\\ndisappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other;\\nand checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an\\nappearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally\\nopposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot, certainly.\\nHe has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may be\\nmistaken, I might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,\\nrecomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself\\nwell.\\n\\nThe visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them\\noff, and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began\\nwith--\\n\\n\"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.  I\\nhave been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.  A'n't\\nI a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.\\nIt holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will not be\\nsorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.  Have not I done\\nwell, mother?\"\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect\\nreadiness for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when\\nMary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?  Take a box\\nfor to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden\\nPlace to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked to meet\\nLady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all the principal\\nfamily connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?  How can you be\\nso forgetful?\"\\n\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" replied Charles, \"what's an evening party?  Never worth\\nremembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if he\\nhad wanted to see us.  You may do as you like, but I shall go to the\\nplay.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you\\npromised to go.\"\\n\\n\"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word\\n'happy.'  There was no promise.\"\\n\\n\"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.  We were\\nasked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always such a great\\nconnexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.  Nothing ever happened\\non either side that was not announced immediately.  We are quite near\\nrelations, you know; and Mr Elliot too, whom you ought so particularly\\nto be acquainted with!  Every attention is due to Mr Elliot.  Consider,\\nmy father's heir:  the future representative of the family.\"\\n\\n\"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried Charles.  \"I\\nam not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising\\nsun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it\\nscandalous to go for the sake of his heir.  What is Mr Elliot to me?\"\\nThe careless expression was life to Anne, who saw that Captain\\nWentworth was all attention, looking and listening with his whole soul;\\nand that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to\\nherself.\\n\\nCharles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious\\nand half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,\\ninvariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to make\\nit known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself, she\\nshould not think herself very well used, if they went to the play\\nwithout her.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.\\n\\n\"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back and\\nchange the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided, and we\\nshould be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's;\\nand I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,\\nif Miss Anne could not be with us.\"\\n\\nAnne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much so\\nfor the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--\\n\\n\"If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home\\n(excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment.  I\\nhave no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to\\nchange it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better not be\\nattempted, perhaps.\"  She had spoken it; but she trembled when it was\\ndone, conscious that her words were listened to, and daring not even to\\ntry to observe their effect.\\n\\nIt was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; Charles\\nonly reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife, by persisting\\nthat he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place; probably\\nfor the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards, and taking a\\nstation, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.\\n\\n\"You have not been long enough in Bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy the evening\\nparties of the place.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me.  I am no\\ncard-player.\"\\n\\n\"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards; but\\ntime makes many changes.\"\\n\\n\"I am not yet so much changed,\" cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she\\nhardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments he said,\\nand as if it were the result of immediate feeling, \"It is a period,\\nindeed!  Eight years and a half is a period.\"\\n\\nWhether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne's imagination\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds he\\nhad uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta, eager to\\nmake use of the present leisure for getting out, and calling on her\\ncompanions to lose no time, lest somebody else should come in.\\n\\nThey were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready, and\\ntried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the\\nregret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair, in preparing\\nto quit the room, she would have found, in all her own sensations for\\nher cousin, in the very security of his affection, wherewith to pity\\nher.\\n\\nTheir preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds were\\nheard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for Sir\\nWalter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill.\\nAnne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked saw symptoms\\nof the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was\\nover, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk,\\nto meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.  How\\nmortifying to feel that it was so!\\n\\nHer jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth was\\nacknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.\\nShe even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.\\nElizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel\\nexplained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper\\nnothings, she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all\\nthe remaining dues of the Musgroves.  \"To-morrow evening, to meet a few\\nfriends:  no formal party.\" It was all said very gracefully, and the\\ncards with which she had provided herself, the \"Miss Elliot at home,\"\\nwere laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all,\\nand one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The\\ntruth was, that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.  The past\\nwas nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about\\nwell in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given, and Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth arose and disappeared.\\n\\nThe interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out, but not\\nto Anne.  She could think only of the invitation she had with such\\nastonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which it had been\\nreceived; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather than\\ngratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.  She\\nknew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement for\\nall the insolence of the past.  Her spirits sank.  He held the card in\\nhis hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\\n\\n\"Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody!\" whispered Mary very\\naudibly.  \"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!  You see he\\ncannot put the card out of his hand.\"\\n\\nAnne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that she\\nmight neither see nor hear more to vex her.\\n\\nThe party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladies\\nproceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Anne\\nbelonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine, and\\ngive them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been so long\\nexerted that at present she felt unequal to more, and fit only for\\nhome, where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose.\\n\\nPromising to be with them the whole of the following morning,\\ntherefore, she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to\\nCamden Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the\\nbusy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the\\nfrequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continually\\nimproving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the\\nmost completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself\\nwith the never-ending question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come\\nor not?  They were reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a\\ngnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together.  She\\ngenerally thought he would come, because she generally thought he\\nought; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive\\nact of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions of\\nvery opposite feelings.\\n\\nShe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,\\nto let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours\\nafter his being supposed to be out of Bath, for having watched in vain\\nfor some intimation of the interview from the lady herself, she\\ndetermined to mention it, and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs\\nClay's face as she listened.  It was transient: cleared away in an\\ninstant; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of\\nhaving, by some complication of mutual trick, or some overbearing\\nauthority of his, been obliged to attend (perhaps for half an hour) to\\nhis lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter.  She\\nexclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature:--\\n\\n\"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise I\\nmet with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.  He\\nturned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He had been prevented\\nsetting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a\\nhurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his being\\ndetermined not to be delayed in his return.  He wanted to know how\\nearly he might be admitted to-morrow.  He was full of 'to-morrow,' and\\nit is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I\\nentered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that\\nhad happened, or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of\\nmy head.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\n\\nOne day only had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs Smith; but a\\nkeener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched by Mr\\nElliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it became\\na matter of course the next morning, still to defer her explanatory\\nvisit in Rivers Street.  She had promised to be with the Musgroves from\\nbreakfast to dinner.  Her faith was plighted, and Mr Elliot's\\ncharacter, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head, must live another\\nday.\\n\\nShe could not keep her appointment punctually, however; the weather was\\nunfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain on her friends'\\naccount, and felt it very much on her own, before she was able to\\nattempt the walk.  When she reached the White Hart, and made her way to\\nthe proper apartment, she found herself neither arriving quite in time,\\nnor the first to arrive.  The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove,\\ntalking to Mrs Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and\\nshe immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait,\\nhad gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon,\\nand that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to\\nkeep her there till they returned.  She had only to submit, sit down,\\nbe outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once in all the\\nagitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little\\nbefore the morning closed.  There was no delay, no waste of time.  She\\nwas deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such\\nhappiness, instantly.  Two minutes after her entering the room, Captain\\nWentworth said--\\n\\n\"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now, if you\\nwill give me materials.\"\\n\\nMaterials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it, and nearly\\nturning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter's\\nengagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was\\nperfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.  Anne felt that\\nshe did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville\\nseemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearing\\nmany undesirable particulars; such as, \"how Mr Musgrove and my brother\\nHayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter\\nhad said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what\\nhad occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished,\\nand what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards\\npersuaded to think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same\\nstyle of open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every\\nadvantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not\\ngive, could be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft\\nwas attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, it\\nwas very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much\\nself-occupied to hear.\\n\\n\"And so, ma'am, all these thing considered,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in her\\npowerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different, yet,\\naltogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for\\nCharles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near\\nas bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the\\nbest of it, as many others have done before them.  At any rate, said I,\\nit will be better than a long engagement.\"\\n\\n\"That is precisely what I was going to observe,\" cried Mrs Croft.  \"I\\nwould rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and\\nhave to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved in\\na long engagement.  I always think that no mutual--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear Mrs Croft,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her finish her\\nspeech, \"there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long\\nengagement.  It is what I always protested against for my children.  It\\nis all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, if\\nthere is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, or\\neven in twelve; but a long engagement--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, dear ma'am,\" said Mrs Croft, \"or an uncertain engagement, an\\nengagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing that at such a\\ntime there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and\\nunwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can.\"\\n\\nAnne found an unexpected interest here.  She felt its application to\\nherself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,\\nCaptain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,\\nlistening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look, one\\nquick, conscious look at her.\\n\\nThe two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary\\npractice as had fallen within their observation, but Anne heard nothing\\ndistinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear, her mind was in\\nconfusion.\\n\\nCaptain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it, now left\\nhis seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him, though\\nit was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that he\\nwas inviting her to join him where he stood.  He looked at her with a\\nsmile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, \"Come to me, I\\nhave something to say;\" and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner\\nwhich denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was,\\nstrongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself and went to him.\\nThe window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from\\nwhere the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer to Captain\\nWentworth's table, not very near.  As she joined him, Captain\\nHarville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression\\nwhich seemed its natural character.\\n\\n\"Look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying a\\nsmall miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly:  Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But,\" (in a deep tone,) \"it was\\nnot done for her.  Miss Elliot, do you remember our walking together at\\nLyme, and grieving for him?  I little thought then--but no matter.\\nThis was drawn at the Cape.  He met with a clever young German artist\\nat the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to\\nhim, and was bringing it home for her; and I have now the charge of\\ngetting it properly set for another!  It was a commission to me!  But\\nwho else was there to employ?  I hope I can allow for him.  I am not\\nsorry, indeed, to make it over to another.  He undertakes it;\" (looking\\ntowards Captain Wentworth,) \"he is writing about it now.\"  And with a\\nquivering lip he wound up the whole by adding, \"Poor Fanny! she would\\nnot have forgotten him so soon!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"That I can easily\\nbelieve.\"\\n\\n\"It was not in her nature.  She doted on him.\"\\n\\n\"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\"\\n\\nCaptain Harville smiled, as much as to say, \"Do you claim that for your\\nsex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also, \"Yes.  We certainly\\ndo not forget you as soon as you forget us.  It is, perhaps, our fate\\nrather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.  We live at home,\\nquiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.  You are forced on\\nexertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some\\nsort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and\\ncontinual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"\\n\\n\"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\n(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply to\\nBenwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace turned\\nhim on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us, in our\\nlittle family circle, ever since.\"\\n\\n\"True,\" said Anne, \"very true; I did not recollect; but what shall we\\nsay now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from outward\\ncircumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man's nature,\\nwhich has done the business for Captain Benwick.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, it is not man's nature.  I will not allow it to be more man's\\nnature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or\\nhave loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogy\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are\\nthe strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough\\nusage, and riding out the heaviest weather.\"\\n\\n\"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same\\nspirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most\\ntender.  Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.\\nNay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.  You have\\ndifficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.  You\\nare always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.\\nYour home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,\\nnor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed\" (with a\\nfaltering voice), \"if woman's feelings were to be added to all this.\"\\n\\n\"We shall never agree upon this question,\" Captain Harville was\\nbeginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention to Captain\\nWentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.  It was\\nnothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was startled\\nat finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined to\\nsuspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by\\nthem, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think he could\\nhave caught.\\n\\n\"Have you finished your letter?\" said Captain Harville.\\n\\n\"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes.\"\\n\\n\"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.  I am\\nin very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied, and\\nwant for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,\"\\n(lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose,\\nupon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.  But let me\\nobserve that all histories are against you--all stories, prose and\\nverse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fifty\\nquotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I\\never opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon\\nwoman's inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman's\\nfickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in\\nbooks.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.\\nEducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been\\nin their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything.\"\\n\\n\"But how shall we prove anything?\"\\n\\n\"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a\\npoint.  It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.\\nWe each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and\\nupon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has\\noccurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps\\nthose very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as\\ncannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some\\nrespect saying what should not be said.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling, \"if I could\\nbut make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at\\nhis wife and children, and watches the boat that he has sent them off\\nin, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, 'God knows\\nwhether we ever meet again!' And then, if I could convey to you the\\nglow of his soul when he does see them again; when, coming back after a\\ntwelvemonth's absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port,\\nhe calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to\\ndeceive himself, and saying, 'They cannot be here till such a day,' but\\nall the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them\\narrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner\\nstill!  If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear\\nand do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his\\nexistence!  I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\"\\npressing his own with emotion.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Anne eagerly, \"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by\\nyou, and by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should\\nundervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my\\nfellow-creatures!  I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to\\nsuppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman.\\nNo, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married\\nlives.  I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every\\ndomestic forbearance, so long as--if I may be allowed the\\nexpression--so long as you have an object.  I meanwhile the woman you\\nlove lives, and lives for you.  All the privilege I claim for my own\\nsex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of\\nloving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.\"\\n\\nShe could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart was\\ntoo full, her breath too much oppressed.\\n\\n\"You are a good soul,\" cried Captain Harville, putting his hand on her\\narm, quite affectionately.  \"There is no quarrelling with you.  And\\nwhen I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.\"\\n\\nTheir attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking\\nleave.\\n\\n\"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,\" said she.  \"I am\\ngoing home, and you have an engagement with your friend.  To-night we\\nmay have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\" (turning to\\nAnne.)  \"We had your sister's card yesterday, and I understood\\nFrederick had a card too, though I did not see it; and you are\\ndisengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\"\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either\\ncould not or would not answer fully.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but Harville and I shall\\nsoon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready, I am in half a\\nminute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.  I shall be at your\\nservice in half a minute.\"\\n\\nMrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter\\nwith great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried, agitated\\nair, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how to\\nunderstand it.  She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\" from\\nCaptain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!  He had passed\\nout of the room without a look!\\n\\nShe had only time, however, to move closer to the table where he had\\nbeen writing, when footsteps were heard returning; the door opened, it\\nwas himself.  He begged their pardon, but he had forgotten his gloves,\\nand instantly crossing the room to the writing table, he drew out a\\nletter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Anne with eyes\\nof glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time, and hastily collecting his\\ngloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware\\nof his being in it: the work of an instant!\\n\\nThe revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost beyond\\nexpression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible, to \"Miss A.\\nE.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily.\\nWhile supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick, he had been also\\naddressing her!  On the contents of that letter depended all which this\\nworld could do for her.  Anything was possible, anything might be\\ndefied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of\\nher own at her own table; to their protection she must trust, and\\nsinking into the chair which he had occupied, succeeding to the very\\nspot where he had leaned and written, her eyes devoured the following\\nwords:\\n\\n\\n\"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means\\nas are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony, half\\nhope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are\\ngone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your\\nown than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago.  Dare\\nnot say that man forgets sooner than  woman, that his love has an\\nearlier death.  I have loved none but you.  Unjust I may have been,\\nweak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant.  You alone have\\nbrought me to Bath.  For you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not\\nseen this?  Can you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not\\nwaited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think\\nyou must have penetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant\\nhearing something which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.\\nToo good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.  You do\\nbelieve that there is true attachment and constancy among men.  Believe\\nit to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.\\n\\n\"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow\\nyour party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look, will be enough to\\ndecide whether I enter your father's house this evening or never.\"\\n\\n\\nSuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half an hour's\\nsolitude and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten\\nminutes only which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the\\nrestraints of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.\\nEvery moment rather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering\\nhappiness.  And before she was beyond the first stage of full\\nsensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.\\n\\nThe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an\\nimmediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.  She began\\nnot to understand a word they said, and was obliged to plead\\nindisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see that she looked\\nvery ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not stir without her\\nfor the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only have gone away, and\\nleft her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her\\ncure; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was\\ndistracting, and in desperation, she said she would go home.\\n\\n\"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly, and\\ntake care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.  I wish\\nSarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.  Charles, ring\\nand order a chair.  She must not walk.\"\\n\\nBut the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility\\nof speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,\\nsolitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting\\nhim) could not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,\\nand Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness, having\\nassured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in the\\ncase; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blow\\non her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall;\\ncould part with her cheerfully, and depend on finding her better at\\nnight.\\n\\nAnxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--\\n\\n\"I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood.  Pray be so\\ngood as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your\\nwhole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been some mistake; and\\nI wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain\\nWentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.  Captain\\nHarville has no thought but of going.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.\\nWill you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?  You will\\nsee them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain\\nHarville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message.  But indeed,\\nmy dear, you need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite\\nengaged, I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare\\nsay.\"\\n\\nAnne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp\\nthe perfection of her felicity.  It could not be very lasting, however.\\nEven if he did not come to Camden Place himself, it would be in her\\npower to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville.  Another\\nmomentary vexation occurred.  Charles, in his real concern and good\\nnature, would go home with her; there was no preventing him.  This was\\nalmost cruel.  But she could not be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing\\nan engagement at a gunsmith's, to be of use to her; and she set off\\nwith him, with no feeling but gratitude apparent.\\n\\nThey were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something of\\nfamiliar sound, gave her two moments' preparation for the sight of\\nCaptain Wentworth.  He joined them; but, as if irresolute whether to\\njoin or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.  Anne could command\\nherself enough to receive that look, and not repulsively.  The cheeks\\nwhich had been pale now glowed, and the movements which had hesitated\\nwere decided.  He walked by her side.  Presently, struck by a sudden\\nthought, Charles said--\\n\\n\"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street, or\\nfarther up the town?\"\\n\\n\"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.\\n\\n\"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?\\nBecause, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my\\nplace, and give Anne your arm to her father's door.  She is rather done\\nfor this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to\\nbe at that fellow's in the Market Place.  He promised me the sight of a\\ncapital gun he is just going to send off; said he would keep it\\nunpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do\\nnot turn back now, I have no chance.  By his description, a good deal\\nlike the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one day\\nround Winthrop.\"\\n\\nThere could not be an objection.  There could be only the most proper\\nalacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reined\\nin and spirits dancing in private rapture.  In half a minute Charles\\nwas at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceeding\\ntogether:  and soon words enough had passed between them to decide\\ntheir direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel\\nwalk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a\\nblessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the\\nhappiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow.  There\\nthey exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once\\nbefore seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by so\\nmany, many years of division and estrangement.  There they returned\\nagain into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their\\nre-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more\\ntried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and\\nattachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as\\nthey slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around\\nthem, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,\\nflirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those\\nexplanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which\\nwere so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the little\\nvariations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and\\ntoday there could scarcely be an end.\\n\\nShe had not mistaken him.  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding\\nweight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate in the very\\nhour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned, after a short\\nsuspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him in\\neverything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do, in the last\\nfour-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding to the better\\nhopes which her looks, or words, or actions occasionally encouraged; it\\nhad been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which\\nhad reached him while she talked with Captain Harville; and under the\\nirresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper, and\\npoured out his feelings.\\n\\nOf what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.\\nHe persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never been\\nsupplanted.  He never even believed himself to see her equal.  Thus\\nmuch indeed he was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant\\nunconsciously, nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her,\\nand believed it to be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, when\\nhe had only been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because\\nhe had been a sufferer from them.  Her character was now fixed on his\\nmind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of\\nfortitude and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only\\nat Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he\\nbegun to understand himself.  At Lyme, he had received lessons of more\\nthan one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused\\nhim, and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville's had fixed her\\nsuperiority.\\n\\nIn his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove (the\\nattempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever felt it to\\nbe impossible; that he had not cared, could not care, for Louisa;\\nthough till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followed\\nit, he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which\\nLouisa's could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold\\nit possessed over his own.  There, he had learnt to distinguish between\\nthe steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the\\ndarings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind.  There\\nhe had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had\\nlost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of\\nresentment, which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in\\nhis way.\\n\\nFrom that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner been\\nfree from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of\\nLouisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again, than he\\nhad begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\\n\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!\\nThat neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual\\nattachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree, I could\\ncontradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others\\nmight have felt the same--her own family, nay, perhaps herself--I was\\nno longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour if she wished it.\\nI had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously on this subject\\nbefore.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its\\ndanger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be\\ntrying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the\\nrisk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill\\neffects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\"\\n\\nHe found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself; and that\\nprecisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at\\nall, he must regard himself as bound to her, if her sentiments for him\\nwere what the Harvilles supposed.  It determined him to leave Lyme, and\\nawait her complete recovery elsewhere.  He would gladly weaken, by any\\nfair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might\\nexist; and he went, therefore, to his brother's, meaning after a while\\nto return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require.\\n\\n\"I was six weeks with Edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.  I could\\nhave no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you very\\nparticularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little\\nsuspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"\\n\\nAnne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder for a\\nreproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured, in her\\neight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm of earlier\\nyouth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to\\nAnne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be the\\nresult, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\\n\\nHe had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own\\npride, and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released\\nfrom Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her\\nengagement with Benwick.\\n\\n\"Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least\\nput myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do\\nsomething.  But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for\\nevil, had been dreadful.  Within the first five minutes I said, 'I will\\nbe at Bath on Wednesday,' and I was.  Was it unpardonable to think it\\nworth my while to come? and to arrive with some degree of hope?  You\\nwere single.  It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the\\npast, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine.  I could\\nnever doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to\\na certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better\\npretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, 'Was this\\nfor me?'\"\\n\\nTheir first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but the\\nconcert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite\\nmoments.  The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to\\nspeak to him:  the moment of Mr Elliot's appearing and tearing her\\naway, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning hope or\\nincreasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy.\\n\\n\"To see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be my\\nwell-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!\\nTo consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to\\ninfluence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or\\nindifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be his!  Was it\\nnot enough to make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I look\\non without agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind\\nyou, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her\\ninfluence, the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had\\nonce done--was it not all against me?\"\\n\\n\"You should have distinguished,\" replied Anne.  \"You should not have\\nsuspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.\\nIf I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to\\npersuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.  When I yielded,\\nI thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here.  In\\nmarrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred,\\nand all duty violated.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but I could not.\\nI could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of\\nyour character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,\\nburied, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under\\nyear after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded, who\\nhad given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.\\nI saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of\\nmisery.  I had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  The\\nforce of habit was to be added.\"\\n\\n\"I should have thought,\" said Anne, \"that my manner to yourself might\\nhave spared you much or all of this.\"\\n\\n\"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to\\nanother man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet, I was\\ndetermined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning, and\\nI felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.\"\\n\\nAt last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house\\ncould have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, she\\nre-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some\\nmomentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.  An interval\\nof meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective of\\neverything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went to her\\nroom, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her\\nenjoyment.\\n\\nThe evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company\\nassembled.  It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who\\nhad never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace\\nbusiness, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne\\nhad never found an evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility\\nand happiness, and more generally admired than she thought about or\\ncared for, she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature\\naround her.  Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.\\nThe Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrymple\\nand Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.  She\\ncared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in the public\\nmanners of her father and sister.  With the Musgroves, there was the\\nhappy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted\\nintercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at\\nconversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral\\nand Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest,\\nwhich the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain\\nWentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and\\nalways the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his being there.\\n\\nIt was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied in\\nadmiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--\\n\\n\"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of\\nthe right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe\\nthat I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly\\nright in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you\\ndo now.  To me, she was in the place of a parent.  Do not mistake me,\\nhowever.  I am not saying that she did not err in her advice.  It was,\\nperhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the\\nevent decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any\\ncircumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean,\\nthat I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had done\\notherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement\\nthan I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my\\nconscience.  I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in\\nhuman nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a\\nstrong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman's portion.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her,\\nreplied, as if in cool deliberation--\\n\\n\"Not yet.  But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.  I trust\\nto being in charity with her soon.  But I too have been thinking over\\nthe past, and a  question has suggested itself, whether there may not\\nhave been one person more my enemy even than that lady?  My own self.\\nTell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few\\nthousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written\\nto you, would you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short, have\\nrenewed the engagement then?\"\\n\\n\"Would I!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.\\n\\n\"Good God!\" he cried, \"you would!  It is not that I did not think of\\nit, or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success; but I\\nwas proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.  I shut\\nmy eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.  This is a\\nrecollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than\\nmyself.  Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared.\\nIt is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.  I have been used to the\\ngratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I\\nenjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards.\\nLike other great men under reverses,\" he added, with a smile. \"I must\\nendeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.  I must learn to brook being\\nhappier than I deserve.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\n\\nWho can be in doubt of what followed?  When any two young people take\\nit into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance to\\ncarry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or ever\\nso little likely to be necessary to each other's ultimate comfort.\\nThis may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be\\ntruth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and\\nan Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness\\nof right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing\\ndown every opposition?  They might in fact, have borne down a great\\ndeal more than they met with, for there was little to distress them\\nbeyond the want of graciousness and warmth.  Sir Walter made no\\nobjection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and\\nunconcerned.  Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds,\\nand as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him,\\nwas no longer nobody.  He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the\\ndaughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet, who had not had principle\\nor sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which\\nProvidence had placed him, and who could give his daughter at present\\nbut a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers\\nhereafter.\\n\\nSir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne, and no vanity\\nflattered, to make him really happy on the occasion, was very far from\\nthinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary, when he saw more of\\nCaptain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well,\\nhe was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his\\nsuperiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her\\nsuperiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name,\\nenabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace,\\nfor the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.\\n\\nThe only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite any\\nserious anxiety was Lady Russell.  Anne knew that Lady Russell must be\\nsuffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot, and\\nbe making some struggles to become truly acquainted with, and do\\njustice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what Lady Russell had\\nnow to do.  She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with\\nregard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in\\neach; that because Captain Wentworth's manners had not suited her own\\nideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a\\ncharacter of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Elliot's\\nmanners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness,\\ntheir general politeness and suavity, she had been too quick in\\nreceiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and\\nwell-regulated mind.  There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do,\\nthan to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong, and to take up\\na new set of opinions and of hopes.\\n\\nThere is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment\\nof character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience in\\nothers can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of\\nunderstanding than her young friend.  But she was a very good woman,\\nand if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging, her first\\nwas to see Anne happy.  She loved Anne better than she loved her own\\nabilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found\\nlittle hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was\\nsecuring the happiness of her other child.\\n\\nOf all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\nby the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married, and\\nshe might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the\\nconnexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn; and as her own\\nsister must be better than her husband's sisters, it was very agreeable\\nthat Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain\\nBenwick or Charles Hayter.  She had something to suffer, perhaps, when\\nthey came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored to the rights of\\nseniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had a\\nfuture to look forward to, of powerful consolation.  Anne had no\\nUppercross Hall before her, no landed estate, no headship of a family;\\nand if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet,\\nshe would not change situations with Anne.\\n\\nIt would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\nwith her situation, for a change is not very probable there.  She had\\nsoon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw, and no one of\\nproper condition has since presented himself to raise even the\\nunfounded hopes which sunk with him.\\n\\nThe news of his cousin Anne's engagement burst on Mr Elliot most\\nunexpectedly.  It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness, his\\nbest hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a\\nson-in-law's rights would have given.  But, though discomfited and\\ndisappointed, he could still do something for his own interest and his\\nown enjoyment.  He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay's quitting it\\nsoon afterwards, and being next heard of as established under his\\nprotection in London, it was evident how double a game he had been\\nplaying, and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out\\nby one artful woman, at least.\\n\\nMrs Clay's affections had overpowered her interest, and she had\\nsacrificed, for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheming\\nlonger for Sir Walter.  She has abilities, however, as well as\\naffections; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or\\nhers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from\\nbeing the wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at\\nlast into making her the wife of Sir William.\\n\\nIt cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and\\nmortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of their\\ndeception in her.  They had their great cousins, to be sure, to resort\\nto for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow\\nothers, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of\\nhalf enjoyment.\\n\\nAnne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell's meaning to\\nlove Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy to the\\nhappiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of\\nhaving no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.\\nThere she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion in\\ntheir fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment's regret; but\\nto have no family to receive and estimate him properly, nothing of\\nrespectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all the\\nworth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and\\nsisters, was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be\\nsensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity.  She had\\nbut two friends in the world to add to his list, Lady Russell and Mrs\\nSmith.  To those, however, he was very well disposed to attach himself.\\nLady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions, he could now\\nvalue from his heart.  While he was not obliged to say that he believed\\nher to have been right in originally dividing them, he was ready to say\\nalmost everything else in her favour, and as for Mrs Smith, she had\\nclaims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently.\\n\\nHer recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves, and\\ntheir marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend, secured her\\ntwo.  She was their earliest visitor in their settled life; and Captain\\nWentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering her husband's\\nproperty in the West Indies, by writing for her, acting for her, and\\nseeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the\\nactivity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend, fully\\nrequited the services which she had rendered, or ever meant to render,\\nto his wife.\\n\\nMrs Smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,\\nwith some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends to\\nbe often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail\\nher; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have\\nbid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.  She\\nmight have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be\\nhappy.  Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits, as her\\nfriend Anne's was in the warmth of her heart.  Anne was tenderness\\nitself, and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth's\\naffection.  His profession was all that could ever make her friends\\nwish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dim\\nher sunshine.  She gloried in being a sailor's wife, but she must pay\\nthe tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if\\npossible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its\\nnational importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Persuasion, by Jane Austen\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PERSUASION ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 105.txt or 105.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/105/\\n\\nProduced by Sharon Partridge and Martin Ward.

Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\\n\\n\"How so? How can it affect them?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You\\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\\n\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\n\\n\"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\\nsoon as he comes.\"\\n\\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the\\nparty.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\\n\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\\nthe neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to\\ngo, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no\\nnewcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to\\nvisit him if you do not.\"\\n\\n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though\\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.\"\\n\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\\nquickness than her sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You\\ntake delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\"\\n\\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\\nthese last twenty years at least.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you do not know what I suffer.\"\\n\\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\\nvisit them.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\\nall.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\\nwas less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,\\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,\\nshe fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\n\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring\\nhis wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\\npaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\\nsuddenly addressed her with:\\n\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\" said her mother\\nresentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\n\\n\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet him at the\\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\\nof her.\"\\n\\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that you do\\nnot depend on her serving you.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain\\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\n\\n\"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little\\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\"\\n\\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she times\\nthem ill.\"\\n\\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully. \"When is\\nyour next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come back\\ntill the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,\\nfor she will not know him herself.\"\\n\\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\\nMr. Bingley to _her_.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\\nmyself; how can you be so teasing?\"\\n\\n\"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly\\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,\\nMrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as\\nshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will\\ntake it on myself.\"\\n\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \"Nonsense,\\nnonsense!\"\\n\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried he. \"Do\\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\\nMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\\ngreat books and make extracts.\"\\n\\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\n\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return to Mr.\\nBingley.\"\\n\\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If\\nI had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called\\non him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\n\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.\\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy\\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\\nwhile.\\n\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a\\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a\\nword about it till now.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said Mr. Bennet; and,\\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\\n\\n\"What an excellent father you have, girls!\" said she, when the door was\\nshut. \"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\\nor me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so\\npleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\\nfor your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\\nball.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\\nyoungest, I'm the tallest.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\\nreturn Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to\\ndinner.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\n\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\\ndaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her\\nhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\\nin various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\\ndistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at\\nlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\\nLady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\\ndelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\nagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\\nwith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\\ndancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\\nhopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.\\n\\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the others equally well\\nmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\n\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about\\nten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\\nadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had\\nheard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\\nfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper\\nwindow that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.\\n\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already\\nhad Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\\nhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\\nwas obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable\\nto accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\\ndisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\\nhe might be always flying about from one place to another, and never\\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears\\na little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get\\na large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley\\nwas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.\\nThe girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the\\nday before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only\\nsix with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when\\nthe party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five\\naltogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and\\nanother young man.\\n\\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\\nwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\\nof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\\nthe report which was in general circulation within five minutes\\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he\\nwas much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\\nproud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all\\nhis large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared\\nwith his friend.\\n\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\\npeople in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving\\none himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\\nthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\nHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\\nin the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\\nAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\\nhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\\n\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\\nstanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.\\nBingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend\\nto join it.\\n\\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance. I hate to see you\\nstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\\ndance.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this\\nit would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\\nanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\\nstand up with.\"\\n\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley, \"for a\\nkingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in\\nmy life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\\nuncommonly pretty.\"\\n\\n\"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\" said Mr.\\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n\\n\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\\ndare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"\\n\\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a moment at\\nElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:\\n\"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no\\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\\nby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"\\n\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\\nremained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,\\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\\n\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as\\nher mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's\\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\nfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they\\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With\\na book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on\\nthe stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a\\ndifferent story to hear.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have had a most\\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\\nher twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her\\ntwice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\\nup with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\ndown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\\nasked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,\\nand the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,\\nand the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--\"\\n\\n\"If he had had any compassion for _me_,\" cried her husband impatiently,\\n\"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of\\nhis partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\\nhandsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw\\nanything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.\\nHurst's gown--\"\\n\\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not\\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\\nall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring\\nhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\\ngreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\\ndear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\n\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very\\nmuch she admired him.\\n\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible,\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much\\nease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\\n\\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man ought\\nlikewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\"\\n\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\\ndid not expect such a compliment.\"\\n\\n\"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between\\nus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\\ncould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman\\nin the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\\nstupider person.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\\nYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\\nin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\\nwhat I think.\"\\n\\n\"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it\\neverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the\\ngood of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing\\nof the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,\\ntoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you\\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\\nneighbour in her.\"\\n\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at\\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,\\nand with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she\\nwas very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine\\nladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the\\npower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\\nconceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the\\nfirst private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\\npounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of\\nassociating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect\\nentitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of\\na respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\\nimpressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their\\nown had been acquired by trade.\\n\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\\nestate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\\nsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a\\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\\npurchase.\\n\\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\\nthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\\nage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation\\nto look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for\\nhalf-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal\\nrooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it\\nimmediately.\\n\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of\\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\\nnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley\\nhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.\\nIn understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\\ndeficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\\nreserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not\\ninviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\ngiving offense.\\n\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or\\nprettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive\\nto him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt\\nacquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not\\nconceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a\\ncollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for\\nnone of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received\\neither attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\\nbut she smiled too much.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired\\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one\\nwhom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\\nestablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such\\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\n\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.\\nThe distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a\\ndisgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;\\nand, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house\\nabout a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,\\nwhere he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,\\nunshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all\\nthe world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\\nsupercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By\\nnature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.\\nJames's had made him courteous.\\n\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\\nof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\\nElizabeth's intimate friend.\\n\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over\\na ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\\n\\n\"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said Mrs. Bennet with civil\\nself-command to Miss Lucas. \"_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he\\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\\nabout Mr. Robinson.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not\\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton\\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many\\npretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\\nanswering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\\nbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as\\nif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\"\\n\\n\"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,\" said\\nCharlotte. \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\\nis he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his\\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite\\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\\nsat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.\"\\n\\n\"Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?\" said Jane.\\n\"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\n\\n\"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at\\nbeing spoke to.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much,\\nunless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably\\nagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\\nwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to\\nthe ball in a hack chaise.\"\\n\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas, \"but I\\nwish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\n\\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance with _him_,\\nif I were you.\"\\n\\n\"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.\"\\n\\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend _me_ so much as pride\\noften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\\nto be proud.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily forgive\\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\"\\n\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\\nreflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\\nquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\\nthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may\\nbe proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\\nourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\n\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who came with\\nhis sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.\"\\n\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said Mrs.\\nBennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\\ndirectly.\"\\n\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\\nwould, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\n\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\\nwas soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on\\nthe goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\\nfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\\na wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards\\nthe two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest\\npleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment\\nof everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\\nthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\\nall probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It\\nwas generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and\\nto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\\nunited, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\\nuniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions\\nof the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\n\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to impose\\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\\nso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in\\nthe dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_\\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\\n\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can\\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to\\ndiscover it too.\"\\n\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.\"\\n\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\\nit, he must find it out.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane\\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they\\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\\ntherefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his\\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for\\nfalling in love as much as she chooses.\"\\n\\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is in\\nquestion but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined\\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\\nthese are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,\\nshe cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its\\nreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\\nand has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite\\nenough to make her understand his character.\"\\n\\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\\nremember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four\\nevenings may do a great deal.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they\\nboth like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other\\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and\\nif she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\\nchance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\\ntwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\\nthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or\\never so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\"\\n\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth\\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\\ninterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\\nallowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly\\nhad a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\\nthis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\\nin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\\nthis she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made\\nhimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\\nto dance with.\\n\\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing\\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\\ndrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were\\nassembled.\\n\\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by listening to my\\nconversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\n\\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\\n\\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see\\nwhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\"\\n\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\\nany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\\na subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\\nturned to him and said:\\n\\n\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\\nwell just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\\nMeryton?\"\\n\\n\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\nenergetic.\"\\n\\n\"You are severe on us.\"\\n\\n\"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas. \"I am going\\nto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\"\\n\\n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\\nto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken\\na musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\\nreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\\nhearing the very best performers.\" On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,\\nshe added, \"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\" And gravely glancing\\nat Mr. Darcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\\ncourse familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I\\nshall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\n\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\\nor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that\\nshe would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\\nsister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\\nthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\\nimpatient for display.\\n\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\\napplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\\nmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\\nhad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,\\nwith some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\\ndancing at one end of the room.\\n\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\\nmuch engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was\\nhis neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\\n\\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There\\nis nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first\\nrefinements of polished society.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\\nthe less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.\"\\n\\nSir William only smiled. \"Your friend performs delightfully,\" he\\ncontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \"and I doubt\\nnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\\nyou often dance at St. James's?\"\\n\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\"\\n\\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\n\\n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\n\\n\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond\\nof superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\n\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed\\nto make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\\nstruck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\\nher:\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.\"\\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though\\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\\ndrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:\\n\\n\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\\nnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\\nher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\\nall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\\n\\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny\\nme the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\\nfor one half-hour.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\\n\\n\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,\\nwe cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a\\npartner?\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not\\ninjured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:\\n\\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\\n\\n\"I should imagine not.\"\\n\\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings\\nin this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.\\nI was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the\\nnothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would\\nI give to hear your strictures on them!\"\\n\\n\"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\\nagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\\nMr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\\n\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley. \"I am all astonishment.\\nHow long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you\\njoy?\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's\\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\\nto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is\\nabsolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;\\nand, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.\"\\n\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to\\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\\nthat all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\nMr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\\nthousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\\nin default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's\\nfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\\nthe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\\nhad left her four thousand pounds.\\n\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to\\ntheir father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\\nLondon in a respectable line of trade.\\n\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\\nconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\\nthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and\\nto a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\\nCatherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;\\ntheir minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing\\nbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\\nhours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\\nthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\\nfrom their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with\\nnews and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the\\nneighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the\\nheadquarters.\\n\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most\\ninteresting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge\\nof the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a\\nsecret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.\\nPhillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of\\nfelicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and\\nMr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation\\nto their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the\\nregimentals of an ensign.\\n\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\nBennet coolly observed:\\n\\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\\nof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\\nI am now convinced.\"\\n\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\\nindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,\\nand her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\\nnext morning to London.\\n\\n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you should be so\\nready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\\nof anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however.\"\\n\\n\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\\n\\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\\nhad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\\nso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\\nfoolish.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\\ntheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\\nnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when\\nI liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\\nheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\\nshould want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\\nColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in\\nhis regimentals.\"\\n\\n\"Mamma,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\\nCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first\\ncame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with\\na note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\\nfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\\neagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\\n\\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\\nJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\\n\\n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\n\\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,--\\n\\n\"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,\\nwe shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,\\nfor a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a\\nquarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the\\ngentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,\\n\\n\"CAROLINE BINGLEY\"\\n\\n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia. \"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of\\n_that_.\"\\n\\n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\\n\\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\\n\\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\\nrain; and then you must stay all night.\"\\n\\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were sure that\\nthey would not offer to send her home.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton,\\nand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\\n\\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\\nwanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\"\\n\\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\\n\\n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my mother's purpose\\nwill be answered.\"\\n\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\\nwere engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\\nmother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a\\nbad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before\\nit rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\\ndelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\\nJane certainly could not come back.\\n\\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet more than\\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the\\nnext morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\\ncontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\\nbrought the following note for Elizabeth:\\n\\n\"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--\\n\\n\"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\\nimputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not\\nhear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.\\nJones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been\\nto me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\\nmatter with me.--Yours, etc.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\\naloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\\nshould die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\\nMr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling\\ncolds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is\\nall very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though\\nthe carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking\\nwas her only alternative. She declared her resolution.\\n\\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such a\\nthing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\\nthere.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\"\\n\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the\\nhorses?\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing\\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\"\\n\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but every\\nimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\\nexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\"\\n\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and Lydia.\\nElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\\ntogether.\\n\\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps we may\\nsee something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\n\\nIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\\nof the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\\nfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\\nover puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\\nwithin view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face\\nglowing with the warmth of exercise.\\n\\nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\\nThat she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such\\ndirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\\nMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\\nfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\\nbrother's manners there was something better than politeness; there\\nwas good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\\nHurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\\nbrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as\\nto the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\\nthinking only of his breakfast.\\n\\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\\nBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not\\nwell enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\\nalarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed\\nfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\\nhowever, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them\\ntogether, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\\nher.\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\\nbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\\nsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having\\nexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught\\na violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\\nwas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\\nached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in\\nfact, nothing to do elsewhere.\\n\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\\nunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\\nwanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\\nin parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\\nof the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.\\nElizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to\\nLongbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply\\nof clothes.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\n\\nAt five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\\nElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very\\nfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\\nthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\\nshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\\nbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\nindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored\\nElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\\n\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\\nregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\\nattentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling\\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\\nothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\\nengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\\neat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain\\ndish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\n\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\\npronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;\\nshe had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the\\nsame, and added:\\n\\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\\nlooked almost wild.\"\\n\\n\"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\\nin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\\nhide it not doing its office.\"\\n\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but this was\\nall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably\\nwell when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\\nescaped my notice.\"\\n\\n\"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and I am\\ninclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such\\nan exhibition.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\\nabove her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by\\nit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\\na most country-town indifference to decorum.\"\\n\\n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\\nBingley.\\n\\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \"that\\nthis adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\" A\\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\\n\\n\"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very\\nsweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with\\nsuch a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is\\nno chance of it.\"\\n\\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\nMeryton.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\\n\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\\n\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\" cried Bingley, \"it\\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\\nconsideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\n\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\\ntheir dear friend's vulgar relations.\\n\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on\\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and\\nwhen it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\\ndownstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\\nthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\\nbelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\n\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great\\nreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\n\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I am\\n_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\n\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and\\nI hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.\"\\n\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the\\ntable where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\\nothers--all that his library afforded.\\n\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\\nthan I ever looked into.\"\\n\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\\nin the room.\\n\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left\\nso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\n\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\\ngenerations.\"\\n\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\\nbooks.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\\nthese.\"\\n\\n\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\n\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\n\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\n\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\\n\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very\\nlittle attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew\\nnear the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his\\neldest sister, to observe the game.\\n\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will\\nshe be as tall as I am?\"\\n\\n\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or\\nrather taller.\"\\n\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished\\nfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\"\\n\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience\\nto be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\\n\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\\nnet purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure\\nI never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\\ninformed that she was very accomplished.\"\\n\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has\\ntoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\\notherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very\\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\\ncannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my\\nacquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\n\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your\\nidea of an accomplished woman.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\\nwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\\ndancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides\\nall this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\\nwill be but half-deserved.\"\\n\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must\\nyet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\\nextensive reading.\"\\n\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\"\\n\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\\nthis?\"\\n\\n\"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and\\napplication, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\\nbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\\nconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\\nroom.\\n\\n\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,\\n\"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the\\nother sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\\nsucceeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\\n\"there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\\nto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\\ndespicable.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\ncontinue the subject.\\n\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\\nthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for\\nimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\\neminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\\nunwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled\\nthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\\nwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\ndeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\\nhowever, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief\\nto his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\\nattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\n\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the\\nmorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\\ninquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\\nand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\\nsisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\\nnote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\\nown judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and\\nits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\\ntwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\n\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\\nvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\\nnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\\nrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\\nwould not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried\\nhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\\nit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\nBingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\\nattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\\nthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\\n\\n\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill to be\\nmoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\\na little longer on your kindness.\"\\n\\n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley. \"It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\\nsure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\n\\n\"You may depend upon it, Madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\\n\"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she\\nremains with us.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do not\\nknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers\\na vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\\nalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\\ntemper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are\\nnothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a\\ncharming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the\\ncountry that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it\\nin a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.\"\\n\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\\nminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\"\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning towards her.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\\nthrough I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\n\\n\"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate\\ncharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not run on in\\nthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\n\\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that you were a\\nstudier of character. It must be an amusing study.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\\nleast that advantage.\"\\n\\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few subjects for\\nsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\\nunvarying society.\"\\n\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\\nobserved in them for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning\\na country neighbourhood. \"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\\ngoing on in the country as in town.\"\\n\\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\\nturned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\\nvictory over him, continued her triumph.\\n\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\\nmy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\\npleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\\n\\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it;\\nand when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their\\nadvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\n\\n\"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\ngentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing\\nat all.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for her\\nmother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\\nsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,\\nwhich you must acknowledge to be true.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting\\nwith many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\\nneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\"\\n\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\\ncountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards\\nMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\\nsaying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if\\nCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\\n\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\\nWilliam is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So\\ngenteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\\nis my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\\nimportant, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\n\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\n\\n\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\\nmy part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;\\n_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to\\njudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,\\nI assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think\\nCharlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\"\\n\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\\nhas often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast\\nof my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\\nbetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\\npartiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother\\nGardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was\\nsure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he\\ndid not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses\\non her, and very pretty they were.\"\\n\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \"There has\\nbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\\ndiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\"\\n\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\" said Darcy.\\n\\n\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\\nstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\\nam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\\n\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\\ntremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\\nunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\\ncivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\\nher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\\neach other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\\ninto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\\n\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\\nand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\\naffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\\nattention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own\\neasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very\\nequal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\\nabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\\nshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this\\nsudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:\\n\\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\\nyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\\nthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\"\\n\\nLydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes--it would be much better to\\nwait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\\nwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\" she\\nadded, \"I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\\nForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\\ninstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the\\nremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\\ncould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\\nall Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\n\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\\ncontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined\\ntheir party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.\\nMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\\nthe progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by\\nmessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\\nMrs. Hurst was observing their game.\\n\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\\nattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\\ncommendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness\\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\\nexactly in union with her opinion of each.\\n\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\n\\nHe made no answer.\\n\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\n\\n\"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\"\\n\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a\\nyear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!\"\\n\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\"\\n\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\n\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\\npens remarkably well.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you--but I always mend my own.\"\\n\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\n\\nHe was silent.\\n\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;\\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\\nGrantley's.\"\\n\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At\\npresent I have not room to do them justice.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\\nalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me\\nto determine.\"\\n\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\\nease, cannot write ill.\"\\n\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried her\\nbrother, \"because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for\\nwords of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless way\\nimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\"\\n\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which\\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\"\\n\\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm reproof.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\\nhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\\nindirect boast.\"\\n\\n\"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\"\\n\\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\\nthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\\nthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\\nquickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any\\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\\nBennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield\\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very\\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the\\nfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,\\nI believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\\nmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\\nprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\nyou would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\\ndependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better\\nstay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not\\ngo--and at another word, might stay a month.\"\\n\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley did\\nnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much\\nmore than he did himself.\"\\n\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my\\nfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\\nintend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a\\ncircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\\ncould.\"\\n\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions\\nas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for\\nhimself.\"\\n\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,\\nbut which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\\nstand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\\nthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\\nthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\\none argument in favour of its propriety.\"\\n\\n\"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\\nwith you.\"\\n\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\\neither.\"\\n\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\\nfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\\ncircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\"\\n\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\narrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\\nbetween the parties?\"\\n\\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\\nyou, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\\nknow a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\\nwhen he has nothing to do.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\\nrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\\nresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\\nbrother for talking such nonsense.\\n\\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend. \"You dislike an argument,\\nand want to silence this.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\"\\n\\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\n\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\\nfor an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity\\nto the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead\\nthe way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\\nseated herself.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,\\nElizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\\nthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed\\non her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\\nadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her\\nbecause he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,\\nhowever, at last that she drew his notice because there was something\\nmore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\\nany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\\nhim too little to care for his approbation.\\n\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by\\na lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\\nElizabeth, said to her:\\n\\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\\nopportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\n\\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\\nsurprise at her silence.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not immediately\\ndetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'\\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\\ntheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\\nyou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if\\nyou dare.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\\ngallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\\nmanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy\\nhad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\\nbelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\\nshould be in some danger.\\n\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great\\nanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some\\nassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\n\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\\ntheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\\n\\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery\\nthe next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\\ndesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\\nand if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after\\nofficers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\\ncheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\\nwhich your lady possesses.\"\\n\\n\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed\\nin the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the\\njudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\\nlines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for\\nwhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\"\\n\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be\\ncopied.\"\\n\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\\nElizabeth herself.\\n\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley, in some\\nconfusion, lest they had been overheard.\\n\\n\"You used us abominably ill,\" answered Mrs. Hurst, \"running away without\\ntelling us that you were coming out.\"\\n\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\\nby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,\\nand immediately said:\\n\\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\\navenue.\"\\n\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\\nlaughingly answered:\\n\\n\"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear\\nto uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\\nfourth. Good-bye.\"\\n\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of\\nbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered\\nas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\n\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\nsister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the\\ndrawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many\\nprofessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable\\nas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.\\nTheir powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an\\nentertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh\\nat their acquaintance with spirit.\\n\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\\nMiss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had\\nsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\\nhimself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also\\nmade her a slight bow, and said he was \"very glad;\" but diffuseness\\nand warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and\\nattention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\\nshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire\\nto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from\\nthe door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\nelse. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\\ndelight.\\n\\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\ncard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\\nDarcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\\npetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and\\nthe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\\nHurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the\\nsofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;\\nand Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets\\nand rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss\\nBennet.\\n\\nMiss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\\nDarcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she\\nwas perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\\ncould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\\nquestion, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\\namused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\\nsecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant\\nit is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no\\nenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\\nbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\\nan excellent library.\"\\n\\nNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\\ncast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing\\nher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\\ntowards him and said:\\n\\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\\nNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\\nthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are\\nnot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\\npleasure.\"\\n\\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he\\nchooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\nthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send\\nround my cards.\"\\n\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\\ntedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\\nmore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of\\nthe day.\"\\n\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\\nnear so much like a ball.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked\\nabout the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but\\nDarcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In\\nthe desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,\\nturning to Elizabeth, said:\\n\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\\nturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\\nlong in one attitude.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked\\nup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\\ndirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\\nhe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\\nthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\\ninterfere. \"What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\\nmeaning?\"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to be severe\\non us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing\\nabout it.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\\nanything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his\\ntwo motives.\\n\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he, as soon\\nas she allowed him to speak. \"You either choose this method of passing\\nthe evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret\\naffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\\nappear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be\\ncompletely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better\\nas I sit by the fire.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley. \"I never heard anything so\\nabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth. \"We\\ncan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\\nas you are, you must know how it is to be done.\"\\n\\n\"But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has\\nnot yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of\\nmind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will\\nnot expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a\\nsubject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth. \"That is an\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\\nbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a\\nlaugh.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than can be.\\nThe wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their\\nactions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in\\nlife is a joke.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth--\"there are such people, but I hope I\\nam not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.\\nFollies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,\\nand I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely\\nwhat you are without.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study\\nof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\\nunderstanding to ridicule.\"\\n\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\\nsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\"\\n\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\n\\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss Bingley;\\n\"and pray what is the result?\"\\n\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\\nhimself without disguise.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\\nbut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\\nfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the\\nconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others\\nso soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings\\nare not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\\nwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost\\nforever.\"\\n\\n\"_That_ is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable resentment\\n_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\\nreally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.\"\\n\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\\nevil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\"\\n\\n\"And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.\"\\n\\n\"And yours,\" he replied with a smile, \"is willfully to misunderstand\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\nconversation in which she had no share. \"Louisa, you will not mind my\\nwaking Mr. Hurst?\"\\n\\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for\\nit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\n\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the\\nnext morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for\\nthem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on\\nher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\\nwould exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive\\nthem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\nleast not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\\nbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\\nand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them\\nvery well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\\nresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\\ncontrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\\nshe urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at\\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\\nthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\\n\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\\nsaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work\\non Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\\nthen sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike\\nof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\\n\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\\nsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\\nsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\\nshe felt herself to be right.\\n\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at\\nNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss\\nBingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.\\nHe wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\\nshould _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope\\nof influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been\\nsuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\\nin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\\nten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were\\nat one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most\\nconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\\n\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\\nall, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last\\nvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\\nafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her\\nto see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\\ntenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of\\nthe whole party in the liveliest of spirits.\\n\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet\\nwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much\\ntrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their\\nfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\\nglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\\nevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of\\nits animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and\\nElizabeth.\\n\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human\\nnature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of\\nthreadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information\\nfor them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said\\nin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers\\nhad dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it\\nhad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n\\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\nbreakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,\\nbecause I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.\"\\n\\n\"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,\\nunless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners\\nare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.\"\\n\\n\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. \"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.\\nBingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.\\nBingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be\\ngot to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this\\nmoment.\"\\n\\n\"It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person whom I\\nnever saw in the whole course of my life.\"\\n\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being\\neagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.\\n\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:\\n\\n\"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago\\nI answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring\\nearly attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,\\nmay turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\\nPray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing\\nin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own\\nchildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago\\nto do something or other about it.\"\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They\\nhad often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which\\nMrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail\\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\\nfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\\n\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\\nBut if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little\\nsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\n\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of\\nhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\\nfriends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did\\nbefore him?\"\\n\\n\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\\nhead, as you will hear.\"\\n\\n\"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.\\n\\n\"Dear Sir,--\\n\\n\"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured\\nfather always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the\\nmisfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but\\nfor some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might\\nseem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone\\nwith whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, Mrs.\\nBennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\\nreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be\\ndistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has\\npreferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be\\nmy earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her\\nladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which\\nare instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I\\nfeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in\\nall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I\\nflatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and\\nthat the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate\\nwill be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the\\noffered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the\\nmeans of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for\\nit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible\\namends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to\\nreceive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting\\non you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and\\nshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight\\nfollowing, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine\\nis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided\\nthat some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I\\nremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and\\ndaughters, your well-wisher and friend,\\n\\n\"WILLIAM COLLINS\"\\n\\n\"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,\"\\nsaid Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. \"He seems to be a most\\nconscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will\\nprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so\\nindulgent as to let him come to us again.\"\\n\\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if\\nhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\\ndiscourage him.\"\\n\\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he can mean\\nto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his\\ncredit.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady\\nCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying\\nhis parishioners whenever it were required.\\n\\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she. \"I cannot make him\\nout.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he\\nmean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he\\nwould help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the\\nreverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\\nletter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.\"\\n\\n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"the letter does not seem\\ndefective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\\nthink it is well expressed.\"\\n\\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any\\ndegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should\\ncome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\\nreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for\\ntheir mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,\\nand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\\nastonished her husband and daughters.\\n\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\\npoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in\\nneed of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a\\ntall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and\\nstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\\nbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\ndaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this\\ninstance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did\\nnot doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This\\ngallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\\nBennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.\\n\\n\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\\nprove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\\noddly.\"\\n\\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\nmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things\\nI know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\\nwill go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and\\ncould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\\nforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come\\nprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,\\nwhen we are better acquainted--\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\\nother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The\\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\\nand his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's\\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\\nown future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and\\nhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its\\ncooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\\nassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a\\ngood cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He\\nbegged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a\\nquarter of an hour.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\n\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\\nwere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\\nguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\\nshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\\nCatherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for\\nhis comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\nbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\\nto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect\\nhe protested that \"he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in\\na person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\\nexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\\napprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\npreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\\nquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\\npeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\nneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or\\ntwo, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\\nto suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.\"\\n\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"and\\nI dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\\nin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\"\\n\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\\nfrom Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.\"\\n\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?\"\\n\\n\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\nextensive property.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off than\\nmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?\"\\n\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\\nthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\\nhandsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks\\nthe young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\\nconstitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many\\naccomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am\\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\\nresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\\nto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\n\\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\\ncourt.\"\\n\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the\\nBritish court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased\\nwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable\\nto ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that\\nher charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\\nher. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\\npay.\"\\n\\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for you\\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\n\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I\\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\\nas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\\nmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\\nand, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\\nin his pleasure.\\n\\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\\nto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,\\nglad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily\\nassented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything\\nannounced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and\\nbegging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at\\nhim, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some\\ndeliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the\\nvolume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three\\npages, she interrupted him with:\\n\\n\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away\\nRichard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me\\nso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\\nabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\"\\n\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\\nCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\n\\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\\nof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\\nme, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to\\nthem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\"\\n\\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\\nbackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\\nvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's\\ninterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\\nresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\\nyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\\nfor backgammon.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\n\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\\nbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part\\nof his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\\nhad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful\\nacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\\ngiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a\\ngood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\\nprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which\\nhe felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\\nclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\\n\\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\\na wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\\nThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's\\nestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\\npart.\\n\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\\nchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a\\nquarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at\\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. \"As to\\nher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\\nnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her\\n_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her\\nto hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\\ndone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\\nnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\\nthe day before was now high in her good graces.\\n\\nLydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister\\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\\nat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\\nhim after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the\\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\\nthan a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.\\n\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\\nthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were\\nimmediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and\\nnothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in\\na shop window, could recall them.\\n\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\\nthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\\nwith another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was\\nthe very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came\\nto inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the\\nstranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,\\ndetermined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under\\npretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately\\nhad just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had\\nreached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated\\npermission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with\\nhim the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a\\ncommission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the\\nyoung man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.\\nHis appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of\\nbeauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.\\nThe introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness\\nof conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\\nunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together\\nvery agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy\\nand Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the\\nladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\\nbegan the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and\\nMiss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to\\nLongbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated\\nit with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes\\non Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\\nstranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they\\nlooked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\\nBoth changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,\\nafter a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\\ndeigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to\\nimagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\\n\\nIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\n\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\\nMr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's\\npressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of\\nMrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the\\ninvitation.\\n\\nMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,\\nfrom their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was\\neagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as\\ntheir own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing\\nabout, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the\\nstreet, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to\\nNetherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility\\nwas claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She\\nreceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned with\\nas much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous\\nacquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,\\nhowever, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who\\nintroduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an\\nexcess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon\\nput to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,\\nhowever, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that\\nMr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\nlieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the\\nlast hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.\\nWickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the\\noccupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the\\nofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid,\\ndisagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses\\nthe next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips\\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured\\nwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\\n\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either\\nor both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain\\nsuch behaviour than her sister.\\n\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring\\nMrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;\\nfor she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even\\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\\nutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\\nmuch attention in the whole course of his life.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\n\\nAs no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their\\naunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and\\nthe girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in\\nthe house.\\n\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast\\nparlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\\ngratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what\\nRosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the\\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found\\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\\nwith the housekeeper's room.\\n\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and\\nthe improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive\\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\\nsoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the\\ninterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\\nThe gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.\\nThe officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\\ngentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but\\nMr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,\\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\\n\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel\\nthat the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered\\ninteresting by the skill of the speaker.\\n\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\\nlistener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly\\nsupplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he\\nhad the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\n\\n\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be glad\\nto improve myself, for in my situation in life--\" Mrs. Phillips was very\\nglad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\\n\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\\nseemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\\nand exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.\\nAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\\nat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear\\nhim, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\\ntold--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not\\neven mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\\na hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\\n\\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\\ndrop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\\nunderstand.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one. A clear\\nten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more\\ncapable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for\\nI have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my\\ninfancy.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\n\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\\nyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly. \"I have\\nspent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\\ndisagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being\\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_\\nto be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\\nastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\\nanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in\\nthe neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\\nHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\\nhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.\"\\n\\n\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\nill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\\n\\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is\\nlikely to be in this country much longer.\"\\n\\n\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\\nwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense\\nof very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he\\nis. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never\\nbe in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by\\na thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\\nmemory of his father.\"\\n\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\n\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that\\nhe had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very\\nintelligible gallantry.\\n\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added,\\n\"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be\\na most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\\nfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\\nattentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.\\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\\nwas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\\nwere speaking of just now.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\\nelsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be? How could his\\nwill be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?\"\\n\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\\nto it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain\\nit is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was\\nof an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\nanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and\\nI may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can\\nrecall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort\\nof men, and that he hates me.\"\\n\\n\"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\n\\n\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"\\n\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\\never as he expressed them.\\n\\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive? What can\\nhave induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\n\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon\\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\\nnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\\nof preference which was often given me.\"\\n\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\\nhim. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be\\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\\nthis.\"\\n\\nAfter a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\\nmust be dreadful.\"\\n\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham; \"I can hardly\\nbe just to him.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To\\ntreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\\nfather!\" She could have added, \"A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable\"--but she contented herself\\nwith, \"and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,\\nconnected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\\n\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\\npart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,\\nappears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of\\nuse to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the\\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,\\nand when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\\nbe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\"\\n\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable! I wonder that the very\\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better\\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for\\ndishonesty I must call it.\"\\n\\n\"It _is_ wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions may\\nbe traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has\\nconnected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are\\nnone of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\\nimpulses even than pride.\"\\n\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money\\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\\npoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what\\nhis father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,\\nto degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\\ncareful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up\\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.\"\\n\\n\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head. \"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\\nspeak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very\\nproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\\nof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\\nnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\\nand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\\neducation.\"\\n\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\n\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,\\nwho seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\\nbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\\nknow Mr. Bingley?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\\n\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\\nDarcy is.\"\\n\\n\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\\nwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\\nhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is\\na very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His\\npride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\\nsincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something\\nfor fortune and figure.\"\\n\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\\nthe other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\\nElizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every\\npoint; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,\\nhe assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least\\nimportance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged\\nthat she would not make herself uneasy.\\n\\n\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a\\ncard-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I\\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\\nare undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady\\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\\nlittle matters.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\\nwas very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him\\na living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"\\n\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's\\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\\nyesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\"\\n\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\\nBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\\nself-destined for another.\\n\\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\\ndaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,\\nI suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\\npatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\"\\n\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I have\\nnot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her\\nnephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an\\nunderstanding of the first class.\"\\n\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\\nthey continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper\\nput an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\\nWickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise\\nof Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to\\neverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\\nthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\\nas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\\nfish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and\\nMrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\\nthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\n\\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.\\nWickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she\\nknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\\nBingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the\\nveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\\npossibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to\\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be\\ndone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,\\nand throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\\notherwise explained.\\n\\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some way\\nor other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\\nmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\\nconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\\nwithout actual blame on either side.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on\\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\\nbusiness? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\\nsomebody.\"\\n\\n\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\\nopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such\\na manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\\nimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\\ncharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\\nexcessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\"\\n\\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than\\nthat Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me\\nlast night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it\\nbe not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his\\nlooks.\"\\n\\n\"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\\nthink.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\\n\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,\\nif he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair\\nbecame public.\\n\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\\nconversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had\\nbeen speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal\\ninvitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed\\nfor the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their\\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly\\nasked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To\\nthe rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet\\nas much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to\\nthe others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an\\nactivity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if\\neager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.\\n\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered\\nby receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look\\nand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\\nless on any single event, or any particular person, for though they\\neach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\nhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\\nwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\\nhad no disinclination for it.\\n\\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is enough--I\\nthink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those\\nwho consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\\neverybody.\"\\n\\nElizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did\\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if\\nhe did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's\\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke\\neither from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\\ndance.\\n\\n\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a ball\\nof this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,\\ncan have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing\\nmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\\ncousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\\nsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,\\na preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\\ncause, and not to any disrespect for her.\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\\nengaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\\ninstead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help\\nfor it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce\\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as\\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\\ngallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy\\nof being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\\ncivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\\nwas extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\\nto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and\\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\n\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this\\ntime, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there\\nwas such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton\\nonce. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very\\nshoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have\\nfound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the\\nimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than\\na dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and\\nMonday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\n\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty\\nof meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\\nmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose\\nthe dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's\\npleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though\\nthis was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\\npronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who\\ntold them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the\\nday before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,\\n\"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\\nhe had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\n\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\\nElizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\\nWickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every\\nfeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\\nAttendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\\nwith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\\nspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\\n\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\\nspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\\nnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition\\nto the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\\nnotice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;\\nthey were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\\naware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\\npartner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from\\nhim was ecstasy.\\n\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\\nwere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took\\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,\\nwithout knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\\nmind; Charlotte tried to console her:\\n\\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\\na man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\\nevil.\"\\n\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a\\nsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\\nin the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\\nreading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding\\nit. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\\nfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\\nbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\\nsome slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\\nsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\\nwith:--\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked\\nabout the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size\\nof the room, or the number of couples.\"\\n\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may\\nobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But\\n_now_ we may be silent.\"\\n\\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\\n\\n\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\\nentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of\\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the\\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\n\\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\\nposterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\n\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\"\\nsaid he. \"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\\nthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\n\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\n\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\\nthe temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.\"\\n\\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\\nfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\\nconstrained manner said, \"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners\\nas may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of\\n_retaining_ them, is less certain.\"\\n\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\" replied Elizabeth\\nwith emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\\nhis life.\"\\n\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\\nthat moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\\nDarcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on\\nhis dancing and his partner.\\n\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very\\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\\ndisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at\\nher sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then\\nflow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You\\nwill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\\nyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\n\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\\nWilliam's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\\neyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\\nhe turned to his partner, and said, \"Sir William's interruption has made\\nme forget what we were talking of.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\\ninterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.\\nWe have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we\\nare to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\n\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\n\\n\"Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\\nfeelings.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.\"\\n\\n\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\\nsomething else.\"\\n\\n\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\" said he,\\nwith a look of doubt.\\n\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\\nby her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\\nthat you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\\ncreated_.\"\\n\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\n\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\n\\n\"I hope not.\"\\n\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\\nto be secure of judging properly at first.\"\\n\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\n\\n\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\\nto shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\\n\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\n\\nShe shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different\\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\n\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may vary\\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\\n\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\nopportunity.\"\\n\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.\\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\\nsilence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,\\nfor in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards\\nher, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\\nanother.\\n\\nThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and\\nwith an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\\n\\n\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!\\nYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\\nquestions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among\\nhis other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late\\nMr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to\\ngive implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's\\nusing him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has\\nalways been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\nMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but\\nI know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he\\ncannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother\\nthought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to\\nthe officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself\\nout of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent\\nthing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\\nMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,\\nconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\n\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said\\nElizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\\nthan of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can\\nassure you, he informed me himself.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\\n\"Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\"\\n\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself. \"You are much mistaken\\nif you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\\nDarcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\\nElizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\\nWickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\\nbefore the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.\\n\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\\nsister's, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\\nyou may be sure of my pardon.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\nsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\nhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\\nthe probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\\nreceived; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,\\nMr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has\\nbeen very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\n\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\n\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\\nsatisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\\n\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\\nhim _conditionally_ only.\"\\n\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,\" said Elizabeth warmly;\\n\"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\\nBingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of\\nboth gentlemen as I did before.\"\\n\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\\ndelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.\\nBingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\\nin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\nand told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\\nto make a most important discovery.\\n\\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now\\nin the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the\\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\\nthe house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady\\nCatherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have\\nthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to\\ndo, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\\n\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\\nI believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to\\nassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.\"\\n\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him\\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction\\nas an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that\\nit was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\\nside; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her\\nwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\\nceased speaking, replied thus:\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in\\nyour excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your\\nunderstanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide\\ndifference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,\\nand those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that\\nI consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with\\nthe highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of\\nbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to\\nfollow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to\\nperform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to\\nprofit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\\nguide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by\\neducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young\\nlady like yourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\\nDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose\\nastonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced\\nhis speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of\\nit, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the\\nwords \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\" It vexed\\nher to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him\\nwith unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time\\nto speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,\\nwas not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed\\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my\\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying\\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\\nhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\n\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\\nmade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\\nthat very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\\ncould bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of\\nendeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts\\nshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\\nventure near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\\nplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\\nopenly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon\\nbe married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet\\nseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the\\nmatch. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\\nthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and\\nthen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\\nJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\\nshe could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\\ndaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\\nother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\\nable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\\nshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\\nsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\\nBennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\\nchance of it.\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\\nwhisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\\n\\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.\"\\n\\n\"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you\\nto offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\\nso doing!\"\\n\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\\ntalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\\nblushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\nsteady gravity.\\n\\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and\\nchicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\\ntranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and\\nshe had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\\nentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,\\nbut in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\\nexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's\\neyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her\\nprogress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very\\nill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks\\nof the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to\\nfavour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.\\nMary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was\\nweak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at\\nJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to\\nBingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs\\nof derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\\nimperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\\nand when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, \"That will do\\nextremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other\\nyoung ladies have time to exhibit.\"\\n\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\\nElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\\nher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\\n\\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\\nto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time\\nto music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\\nrector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make\\nsuch an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\\noffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\\nas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,\\nespecially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit\\nhim of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\\noccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the\\nfamily.\" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had\\nbeen spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many\\nsmiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his\\nwife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,\\nand observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably\\nclever, good kind of young man.\\n\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to\\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or\\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\\nmust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,\\nand she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\\ngentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\n\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though\\nhe could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her\\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\\nsomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\\nHe assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\\nthat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\nher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\\nthe whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\\nher greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\\ngood-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\\n\\nShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;\\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\\nit.\\n\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by\\na manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of\\nan hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\\nsister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and\\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\\nlong speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord,\\nhow tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\\n\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and\\naddressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he\\nwould make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without\\nthe ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,\\nand he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on\\nher, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next\\nday for a short time.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the\\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\\nsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought\\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\\nElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\n\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\\ndeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at\\nthe moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\\nobservances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On\\nfinding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,\\nsoon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\\n\\n\"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\\ncourse of this morning?\"\\n\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\\nBennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy\\nwill be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I\\nwant you up stairs.\" And, gathering her work together, she was hastening\\naway, when Elizabeth called out:\\n\\n\"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\\nme. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\\ngoing away myself.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.\" And upon\\nElizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to\\nescape, she added: \"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.\\nCollins.\"\\n\\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's\\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to\\nconceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between\\ndistress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as\\nthey were gone, Mr. Collins began.\\n\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected\\nmother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the\\npurport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\\nsoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of\\nmy future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\\nsubject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for\\nmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\\n\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could\\nnot use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,\\nand he continued:\\n\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\\nof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will\\nadd very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought\\nto have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\\nrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\\npatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\\nleft Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\narranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you\\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose\\na gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice\\nand kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\\nanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and\\nrespect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\\nwere directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\\ncan assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not\\nbe for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and\\nI flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\\nin the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's\\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\\n\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\n\\n\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have made no\\nanswer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\\nthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to\\ndecline them.\"\\n\\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\\nhand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a\\nthird time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\\nsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\\nextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\\ntime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\\ncould make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\\nsituation.\"\\n\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins\\nvery gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\\ndisapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of\\nseeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your\\nmodesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You\\nmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\\nof believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may\\nbe considered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she\\nthus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus\\naddressed her:\\n\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on\\nthe first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\\nfemale character.\"\\n\\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me\\nexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\\nto convince you of its being one.\"\\n\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\\nrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\\nbelieving it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is\\nunworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\\nbe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\\nwith the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\nconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\\nmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\\nportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo\\nthe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must\\ntherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,\\nI shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\\n\\n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\\nto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\\nfemale, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking\\nthe truth from her heart.\"\\n\\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\\nbeing acceptable.\"\\n\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make\\nno reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if\\nhe persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\\nencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\\nin such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\\nnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\n\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open\\nthe door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\\nwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\\n\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been\\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\\nand could not help saying so.\\n\\n\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be\\nbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very\\nheadstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will\\n_make_ her know it.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr. Collins; \"but if\\nshe is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\\nnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she\\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not\\nto force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\\n\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \"Lizzy is\\nonly headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\\ngood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\\n\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\\nhusband, called out as she entered the library, \"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you\\nare wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make\\nLizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you\\ndo not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\\non her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by\\nher communication.\\n\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when she had\\nfinished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\\n\\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\"\\n\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\\nmarrying him.\"\\n\\n\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\\nlibrary.\\n\\n\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I have sent for\\nyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\\nyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?\" Elizabeth replied that it was.\\n\"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"\\n\\n\"I have, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\\naccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\n\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\\nbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\\nif you _do_.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,\\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to\\n_insist_ upon her marrying him.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to request.\\nFirst, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\\npresent occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\\nlibrary to myself as soon as may be.\"\\n\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\\nMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\\ncoaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane\\nin her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\\ninterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\\nsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\\nvaried, however, her determination never did.\\n\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\\nHe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin\\ncould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\\nway. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\\ndeserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\n\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\\nthe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\\nher, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are come, for there is such\\nfun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\"\\n\\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,\\nwho came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\\nbreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\\nthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\\nher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her\\nfamily. \"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone,\\n\"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,\\nnobody feels for my poor nerves.\"\\n\\nCharlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as unconcerned\\nas may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided\\nshe can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it\\ninto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\\nyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\\nto maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep\\nyou--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\\nyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\\nand you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\\nto undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\\nto anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\\nno great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it\\nis always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\n\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\nany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the\\nirritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of\\nthem, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with\\nan air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to\\nthe girls, \"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold\\nyour tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation\\ntogether.\"\\n\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\\nLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\\ndetained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\\nherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\\ncuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\\nnot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected\\nconversation: \"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"\\n\\n\"My dear madam,\" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this point.\\nFar be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a voice that marked his\\ndispleasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation\\nto inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a\\nyoung man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;\\nand I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt\\nof my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;\\nfor I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as\\nwhen the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\nestimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect\\nto your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to\\nyour daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\\ncompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my\\nbehalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\\ndismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all\\nliable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\\nMy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\\nconsideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_\\nhas been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\n\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and\\nElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\\nattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her\\nmother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly\\nexpressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,\\nbut by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke\\nto her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\\nhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\nespecially to her friend.\\n\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill\\nhealth. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth\\nhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\\nnot appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on\\nSaturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham\\nwere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\\nHe joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\\naunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was\\nwell talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\\nthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.\\n\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better not meet\\nMr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\\nmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\\nmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.\"\\n\\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full\\ndiscussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly\\nbestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\\nthem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to\\nher. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the\\ncompliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an\\noccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\\n\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\\nfrom Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,\\nhot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and\\nElizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw\\nher dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected\\nherself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual\\ncheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety\\non the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no\\nsooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\\ninvited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,\\nJane, taking out the letter, said:\\n\\n\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good\\ndeal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\\ntheir way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You\\nshall hear what she says.\"\\n\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\\nand of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a\\nhouse. The next was in these words: \"I do not pretend to regret anything\\nI shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;\\nbut we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\ndelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\nlessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved\\ncorrespondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these highflown\\nexpressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;\\nand though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw\\nnothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as\\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to\\nregard it, in the enjoyment of his.\\n\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be\\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\\nhope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\\nforward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\\nintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\\nsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\"\\n\\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\\ntook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\\nCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are\\nalready there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my\\ndearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of\\nthat I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may\\nabound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your\\nbeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the\\nthree of whom we shall deprive you.\"\\n\\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this\\nwinter.\"\\n\\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.\"\\n\\n\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own\\nmaster. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,\\n_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think\\nGeorgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;\\nand the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into\\nsomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of\\nher being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the\\ncountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;\\nher relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's\\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\\ncapable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to\\nfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\\nof so many?\"\\n\\n\"What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\" said Jane as she\\nfinished it. \"Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that\\nCaroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is\\nperfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she\\nsuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\\nput me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?\"\\n\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\n\\n\"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\\nin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him\\nto town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\\ndoes not care about you.\"\\n\\nJane shook her head.\\n\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\\ntogether can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She\\nis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\\ncase is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\\nis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\\nthat when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble\\nin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and\\nI dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\\nmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\\nTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\\nof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\n\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\\nanyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving\\nherself.\"\\n\\n\"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\\nwill not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.\\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\\nelsewhere?\"\\n\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if, upon mature\\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\\nall means to refuse him.\"\\n\\n\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling. \"You must know that\\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\\nnot hesitate.\"\\n\\n\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\\nyour situation with much compassion.\"\\n\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\n\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's\\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\\nso totally independent of everyone.\\n\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\\non the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\\nJane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\\nBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\n\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;\\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\\nto go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\\nBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the\\nconclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had\\nbeen invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two\\nfull courses.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\n\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the\\nchief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\\nElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. \"It keeps him in good\\nhumour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to you than I can express.\"\\nCharlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\\nvery amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\\nhad any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards\\nherself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so\\nfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\\nsecure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very\\nsoon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\\ncharacter, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\\ntill its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost\\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.\\nHis reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\n\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\\nthey entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\\nwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\\nbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\\nhis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure\\nand disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\nestablishment were gained.\\n\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\\nand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present\\ncircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\\nthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\\nexceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\\ninterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer\\nMr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\\nopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\\nshould make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,\\nwere properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes\\nof _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have\\ndone; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's\\ndying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had\\ngained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were\\nin general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible\\nnor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must\\nbe imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly\\neither of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was\\nthe only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,\\nand however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\npreservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at\\nthe age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all\\nthe good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business\\nwas the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship\\nshe valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,\\nand probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\\nshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\\nto give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\\nwhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\\npassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\\ndutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\\ncuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\\nquestions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\\nat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\npublish his prosperous love.\\n\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the\\nfamily, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved\\nfor the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,\\nsaid how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever\\nhis engagements might allow him to visit them.\\n\\n\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\nyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\npossible.\"\\n\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\\nso speedy a return, immediately said:\\n\\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my\\ngood sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\\noffending your patroness.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins, \"I am particularly obliged to you\\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\\nmaterial a step without her ladyship's concurrence.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her\\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\\nand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\"\\n\\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\\naffectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your\\nregard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though\\nmy absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now\\ntake the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my\\ncousin Elizabeth.\"\\n\\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\\nsurprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to\\nunderstand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her\\nyounger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was\\na solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read\\nand improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\nagreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this\\nkind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\\n\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\\nthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from\\npossibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was\\nconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\\nshe could not help crying out:\\n\\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!\"\\n\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\\nstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\\nher composure, and calmly replied:\\n\\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\\n\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\\nfor it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of\\ntheir relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her\\nall imaginable happiness.\\n\\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte. \"You must be surprised,\\nvery much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry\\nyou. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be\\nsatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never\\nwas. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's\\ncharacter, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\\nentering the marriage state.\"\\n\\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\" and after an awkward pause,\\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\\nlonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.\\nIt was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers\\nof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\naccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was\\nnot exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible\\nthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\\nfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a\\nmost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself\\nand sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it\\nwas impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\\nchosen.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\\nshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention\\nit, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to\\nannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\\nand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\\nhouses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but\\nincredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,\\nprotested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\\noften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\n\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\\nwithout anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried\\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\\nmost forbearing courtesy.\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters\\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be\\nhappy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\\nElizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she\\nherself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two\\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\\nconsole and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\\nscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\\nor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she\\ncould at all forgive their daughter.\\n\\nMr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\\nmore foolish than his daughter!\\n\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty\\nand Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\\nto spread at Meryton.\\n\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort\\non Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\\ncalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\\nthough Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\\nenough to drive happiness away.\\n\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that\\nno real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\\nsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,\\nas Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his\\nreturn.\\n\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\\nthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\\nletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to\\ntheir father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\\ntwelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging\\nhis conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\\nrapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection\\nof their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was\\nmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready\\nto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither\\nhe hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,\\nhe added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take\\nplace as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable\\nargument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him\\nthe happiest of men.\\n\\nMr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\\ncomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come\\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\\nand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\\nmost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and\\nthey gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued\\nabsence.\\n\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\\nday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\\nreport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\\nNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\\nfalsehood.\\n\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\\nhis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as\\nshe was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so\\ndishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\\nfrequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters\\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\\nDarcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for\\nthe strength of his attachment.\\n\\nAs for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\\npainful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of\\nconcealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\\nwas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,\\nan hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\\ndid not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed\\nall Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\\ntranquillity.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his\\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\\nfirst introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\\nand luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\\nfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\\nanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,\\nand wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight\\nof Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\\nthem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\\nand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She\\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.\\n\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that Charlotte\\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to\\nmake way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\\nbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\"\\n\\nThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of\\nmaking any answer, she went on as before.\\n\\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\\nnot for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\\n\\n\"What should not you mind?\"\\n\\n\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\\n\\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\ninsensibility.\"\\n\\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How\\nanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own\\ndaughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!\\nWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\"\\n\\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\n\\nMiss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had\\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\\nthe country.\\n\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest\\nof the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\\nwriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied\\nthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline\\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\\nletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an\\ninmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.\\n\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\\nheard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\\nfor her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's\\nassertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no\\ncredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\nto the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,\\nbeen the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\\nwhatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as\\nshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,\\non which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\\ncould think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really\\ndied away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether\\nhe had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\nobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be\\nmaterially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained\\nthe same, her peace equally wounded.\\n\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\\nElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a\\nlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\\nnot help saying:\\n\\n\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no\\nidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But\\nI will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\\nall be as we were before.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\\nnothing.\\n\\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you have\\nno reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\\nacquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,\\nand nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A\\nlittle time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.\"\\n\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort immediately,\\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\\nhas done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good. Your sweetness\\nand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say\\nto you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\\ndeserve.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\\nthe praise on her sister's warm affection.\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want\\nto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not\\nbe afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\\nprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\\nwhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\\nof the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\nsense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the\\nother is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is\\nunaccountable!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\\nruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference\\nof situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and\\nCharlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a\\nlarge family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be\\nready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like\\nregard and esteem for our cousin.\"\\n\\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\\ncould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\\nCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as\\nI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him\\ncannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\\nit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\\nchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\\nyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\\ndanger security for happiness.\"\\n\\n\"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\" replied\\nJane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy\\ntogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\\nmentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\\nyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\\nsaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\\nourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\\nto be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\\nour own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\\nit does.\"\\n\\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\\n\\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\"\\n\\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,\"\\nsaid Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\\nunhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,\\nwant of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,\\nwill do the business.\"\\n\\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what\\nI think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.\"\\n\\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can\\nonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can\\nsecure it.\"\\n\\n\"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\\nhappiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\\nmay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\\nconnections, and pride.\"\\n\\n\"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\" replied Jane;\\n\"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have\\nknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\\nher better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\\nthey should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think\\nherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\\nobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try\\nto part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\\nunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\\nmistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what\\nI should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in\\nthe best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's\\nname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\\nmore, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\\nfor it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with\\nless perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she\\ndid not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the\\neffect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her\\nno more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\\nthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best\\ncomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\\n\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \"So, Lizzy,\" said he one day,\\n\"your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to\\nbeing married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.\\nIt is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction\\namong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to\\nbe long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in\\nMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham\\nbe _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\\nall expect Jane's good fortune.\"\\n\\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that whatever of\\nthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make\\nthe most of it.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom\\nwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn\\nfamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\\nadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\\nheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\\nwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\\npleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they\\nhad known anything of the matter.\\n\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be\\nany extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society\\nof Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\\nallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else\\nMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 25\\n\\n\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\\nMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\\nSaturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\\nside, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason\\nto hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would\\nbe fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his\\nrelations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair\\ncousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another\\nletter of thanks.\\n\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving\\nher brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas\\nat Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly\\nsuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\\nladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived\\nby trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\\nwell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger\\nthan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\\nwoman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the\\ntwo eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.\\nThey had frequently been staying with her in town.\\n\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to\\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was\\ndone she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\\nMrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\\nhad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her\\ngirls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was\\nnothing in it.\\n\\n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got Mr.\\nBingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think\\nthat she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not\\nbeen for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,\\nand she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\\na daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just\\nas much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,\\nsister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of\\nthem, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted\\nso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\\nbefore anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the\\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of\\nlong sleeves.\"\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,\\nin the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her\\nsister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the\\nconversation.\\n\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \"It\\nseems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\" said she. \"I am\\nsorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such\\nas you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl\\nfor a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets\\nher, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.\"\\n\\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will not\\ndo for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often\\nhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\\nindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in\\nlove with only a few days before.\"\\n\\n\"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so\\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\\noften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance,\\nas to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's\\nlove?\"\\n\\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\\nthey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\\noffended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I\\nspoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be\\nfiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\\nJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\\nover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\\nwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she\\nwould be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be\\nof service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\\nanything.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\\nof her sister's ready acquiescence.\\n\\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with regard to\\nthis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\\ntown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\\nout so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,\\nunless he really comes to see her.\"\\n\\n\"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\\nfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such\\na part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may\\nperhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\\nwould hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its\\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\\nnever stirs without him.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\\ncorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\"\\n\\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\n\\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\\npoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being\\nwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\\nconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\\nhopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\\nhis affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends\\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's\\nattractions.\\n\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the\\nBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she\\nhoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,\\nshe might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\\nseeing him.\\n\\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,\\nthe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\\nengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\\nof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\\ndinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\\nmade part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\\non these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's\\nwarm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,\\nfrom what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\\nof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and\\nshe resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\\nHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\\nan attachment.\\n\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\\nunconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,\\nbefore her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very\\npart of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\\nacquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since\\nthe death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher\\nintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of\\nprocuring.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\\ncharacter perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject\\nof discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute\\ndescription which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of\\npraise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both\\nhim and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's\\ntreatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's\\nreputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and\\nwas confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam\\nDarcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 26\\n\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given\\non the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after\\nhonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:\\n\\n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\\nyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\\nopenly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\\nyourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want\\nof fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\\n_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\\nought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you\\nmust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\\nexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\\ngood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\"\\n\\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\\ncan prevent it.\"\\n\\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with\\nMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\\nthe most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\\nme--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\\nof it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does\\nme the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\\nfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\\nsince we see every day that where there is affection, young people\\nare seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into\\nengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\\nof my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it\\nwould be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\\nto be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first\\nobject. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,\\nI will do my best.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\\noften. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.\"\\n\\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: \"very\\ntrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine\\nthat he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\\nso frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the\\nnecessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\\nhonour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope\\nyou are satisfied.\"\\n\\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for\\nthe kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice\\nbeing given on such a point, without being resented.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted\\nby the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,\\nhis arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was\\nnow fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think\\nit inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that\\nshe \"_wished_ they might be happy.\" Thursday was to be the wedding day,\\nand on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she\\nrose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and\\nreluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her\\nout of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:\\n\\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\n\\n\"_That_ you certainly shall.\"\\n\\n\"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?\"\\n\\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\n\\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to\\ncome to Hunsford.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\\nvisit.\\n\\n\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March,\" added Charlotte, \"and I\\nhope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as\\nwelcome as either of them.\"\\n\\nThe wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from\\nthe church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on\\nthe subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their\\ncorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that\\nit should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never\\naddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,\\nand though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\\nsake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters\\nwere received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\\nlike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\\nbe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\\nexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\\nwrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\\nwhich she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most\\nfriendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and\\nRosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\\nfor her own visit there to know the rest.\\n\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their\\nsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\\nwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\\n\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience\\ngenerally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or\\nhearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that\\nher last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been\\nlost.\\n\\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of the\\ntown, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\"\\n\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\\n\"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words, \"but she was very\\nglad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming\\nto London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached\\nher. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\\nengaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\\nMiss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was\\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall\\nsee them soon here.\"\\n\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.\\n\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\\npersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\\nblind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning\\nfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\\nvisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,\\nthe alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no\\nlonger. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\\nprove what she felt.\\n\\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her\\nbetter judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been\\nentirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,\\nthough the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I\\nstill assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was\\nas natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for\\nwishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to\\nhappen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not\\nreturn my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I\\nreceive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that\\nshe had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\ncalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was\\nin every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was\\nperfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,\\nthough I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out\\nas she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on\\nher side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting\\nwrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the\\ncause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know\\nthis anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily\\naccount for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to\\nhis sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\\namiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,\\nbecause, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.\\nHe knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said\\nherself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she\\nwanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I\\ncannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\\nbe almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity\\nin all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,\\nand think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the\\ninvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very\\nsoon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield\\nagain, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better\\nnot mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts\\nfrom our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\\nMaria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.\"\\n\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she\\nconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\\nAll expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\\neven wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on\\nevery review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\\nDarcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly\\nregret what he had thrown away.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth\\nhad such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\\nherself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\\nhe was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\\nsee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\\nHer heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\\nwith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\\npermitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\\nremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself\\nagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\\nin Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\\nNothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to\\nsuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\\nready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\\nsincerely wish him happy.\\n\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the\\ncircumstances, she thus went on: \"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that\\nI have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure\\nand elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and\\nwish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\\ntowards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\\nout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to\\nthink her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My\\nwatchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\ninteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love\\nwith him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\\nImportance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take\\nhis defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the\\nways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\\nhandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 27\\n\\n\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise\\ndiversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and\\nsometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take\\nElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of\\ngoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan\\nand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure\\nas well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing\\nCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There\\nwas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\\nwas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her\\na peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\\nbeen very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,\\nand was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was\\nto accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement\\nof spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became\\nperfect as plan could be.\\n\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\\nand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\\ntold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\\n\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\\nhis side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that\\nElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\\nfirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\\nof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of\\nwhat she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\\nopinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there\\nwas a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to\\nhim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,\\nwhether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable\\nand pleasing.\\n\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\nthink him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a\\ngood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say\\nthat could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much\\ndelight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but\\nshe had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of\\nthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were\\nworn out, like his information.\\n\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\\nas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's\\ndoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when\\nthey entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\\nlooking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\\nlovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\\nwhose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to\\nwait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen\\nher for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\\nkindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\\nshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\n\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her\\nsister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\\nher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\\nspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,\\nto hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and\\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\\nherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\\nacquaintance.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and\\ncomplimented her on bearing it so well.\\n\\n\"But my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss King? I\\nshould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\\nbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,\\nand avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\\nbecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get\\na girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\\nmercenary.\"\\n\\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\\nwhat to think.\"\\n\\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\"\\n\\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death\\nmade her mistress of this fortune.\"\\n\\n\"No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\\naffections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\\nmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\\npoor?\"\\n\\n\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her\\nso soon after this event.\"\\n\\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\\ndecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,\\nwhy should _we_?\"\\n\\n\"_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being\\ndeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose. _He_ shall be\\nmercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.\"\\n\\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\\nto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in\\nDerbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not\\nmuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow\\nwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\\nneither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones\\nworth knowing, after all.\"\\n\\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.\"\\n\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\\nunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\\na tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\\n\\n\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us,\" said Mrs. Gardiner,\\n\"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\\n\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\\nacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. \"Oh, my dear,\\ndear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what delight! what felicity! You\\ngive me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What\\nare young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport\\nwe shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other\\ntravellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We\\n_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.\\nLakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our\\nimaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,\\nwill we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_\\nfirst effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of\\ntravellers.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 28\\n\\n\\nEvery object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to\\nElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had\\nseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\\nand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\\n\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\\nsearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\\nThe palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\\nsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\\n\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\\nroad, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,\\neverything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\\nappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which\\nled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\\nthe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\\nat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\\nliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\\ncoming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\\ninstantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;\\nhis formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\\nfamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\\nneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they\\nwere in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\\nformality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's\\noffers of refreshment.\\n\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\\nin fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its\\naspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,\\nas if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But\\nthough everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to\\ngratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at\\nher friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.\\nWhen Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\nashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her\\neye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but\\nin general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to\\nadmire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to\\nthe fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\\nhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\\ngarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\\nwhich he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most\\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\\nwith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\\nowned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\\nthrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\\ninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\\nwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\\nfields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\\nthe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\\nthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the\\nprospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered\\nthe park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome\\nmodern building, well situated on rising ground.\\n\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\\nbut the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\\nfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\\ntook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\\nprobably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's\\nhelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\\nwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which\\nElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\\nforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\\nCharlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\\nforgotten.\\n\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\\nwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\\nin, observed:\\n\\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\\nde Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\\nbe delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\\ndoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice\\nwhen service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she\\nwill include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\\nhonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\\ncharming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed\\nto walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\\n_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\" added\\nCharlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\n\\nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,\\nand telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,\\nElizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\\nCharlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\\nand composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\\nwas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit\\nwould pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious\\ninterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with\\nRosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\\nfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\\nconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\\nup stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\\nthe door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with\\nagitation, cried out--\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\\nthere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\\nhaste, and come down this moment.\"\\n\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,\\nand down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in\\nquest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the\\ngarden gate.\\n\\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth. \"I expected at least that the pigs\\nwere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\\ndaughter.\"\\n\\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is not\\nLady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;\\nthe other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\\ncreature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\"\\n\\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\\nWhy does she not come in?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\\nwhen Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\\n\\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \"She\\nlooks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\\nmake him a very proper wife.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\\nwith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was\\nstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\\nbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that\\nway.\\n\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\\nthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\\ngirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\\nCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\\nto dine at Rosings the next day.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 29\\n\\n\\nMr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\\nThe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\\nvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\\nwife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity\\nof doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady\\nCatherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.\\n\\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised by\\nher ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at\\nRosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it\\nwould happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who\\ncould have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there\\n(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately\\nafter your arrival!\"\\n\\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir William,\\n\"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\\nmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\\ninstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\"\\n\\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\\nvisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\\nthey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\\nso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\\n\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--\\n\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\\nCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\\nbecomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\\nwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\\nfor anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you\\nfor being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\\npreserved.\"\\n\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\\ndoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\\nobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\\nher ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas\\nwho had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her\\nintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\\nto his presentation at St. James's.\\n\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\nmile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\\nElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\\nraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\\nslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\\nhouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\\ncost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\n\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every\\nmoment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\\nElizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\\nCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\\nmiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought\\nshe could witness without trepidation.\\n\\nFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they\\nfollowed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady\\nCatherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,\\nwith great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had\\nsettled it with her husband that the office of introduction should\\nbe hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those\\napologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.\\n\\nIn spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely\\nawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\\nand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\\nof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\\nquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\\ncomposedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\\nconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\\nvisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\\nsilence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,\\nas marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\\nElizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she\\nbelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.\\n\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\\nshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\\ndaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her\\nbeing so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\\nlikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\\nlittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\\nthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\\nto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\\nher eyes.\\n\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\\nadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\\nand Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\\nlooking at in the summer.\\n\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and\\nall the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had\\nlikewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her\\nladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\\nnothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\\nalacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir\\nWilliam, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law\\nsaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and\\ngave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved\\na novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\\nwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\\nbetween Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\\nlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\\ndinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little\\nMiss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\\nshe was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\\ngentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\\n\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\\nbe done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\\nsubject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to\\nhave her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic\\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as\\nto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\\nregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\\ncare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\\nbeneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an\\noccasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse\\nwith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\\nElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\\nthe least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,\\npretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters\\nshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\\nthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\\nhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been\\nher mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of\\nher questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\\nobserved,\\n\\n\"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your\\nsake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\\noccasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\\nnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss\\nBennet?\"\\n\\n\"A little.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\\ninstrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it\\nsome day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\\n\\n\"One of them does.\"\\n\\n\"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\\nWebbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\\nyou draw?\"\\n\\n\"No, not at all.\"\\n\\n\"What, none of you?\"\\n\\n\"Not one.\"\\n\\n\"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\\nshould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\"\\n\\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\"\\n\\n\"Has your governess left you?\"\\n\\n\"We never had any governess.\"\\n\\n\"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\\nwithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\\nhave been quite a slave to your education.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been\\nthe case.\\n\\n\"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you\\nmust have been neglected.\"\\n\\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\\nwished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\\nread, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\\nidle, certainly might.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had\\nknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\\none. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\\nand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\\nwonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\\nway. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\\nit was but the other day that I recommended another young person,\\nwho was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\\ndelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's\\ncalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady\\nCatherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your\\nyounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma'am, all.\"\\n\\n\"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\\nyounger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters\\nmust be very young?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be\\nmuch in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon\\nyounger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and\\namusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\\nmarry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\\nas the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\\nnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very decidedly\\nfor so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\"\\n\\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth, smiling, \"your\\nladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\\nand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\\ndared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\\n\\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not\\nconceal your age.\"\\n\\n\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables\\nwere placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\\ndown to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\\ntwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\\nparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\\nuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\\nexpressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or\\nhaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\\nother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\\nof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\\nwas employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her\\nfor every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\\nSir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\\nand noble names.\\n\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\\nthe tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\\ngratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\\nround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\\nto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by\\nthe arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\nCollins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon\\nas they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin\\nto give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for\\nCharlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her\\ncommendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy\\nMr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise\\ninto his own hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 30\\n\\n\\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long\\nenough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,\\nand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\\noften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\\nmorning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but\\nwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\\nand Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\ncousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast\\nand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in\\nreading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,\\nwhich fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\\nElizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\\nthe dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\\nmore pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\\nreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\\nmuch less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and\\nshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\\n\\nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\\nwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\\nalong, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\\nwhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\\nalmost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and\\nhad a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\\nprevailed upon to get out.\\n\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\\nnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\\nand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\\nto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\\nhours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,\\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\\nof the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\\nout that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.\\n\\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\ncommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate\\nin her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her\\nby Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to\\nbe quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\\nvillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\\nthem into harmony and plenty.\\n\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\\ncard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\\nof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\\nin the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,\\nhowever, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\\ncomfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with\\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\\noften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she\\nfrequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\\nalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\\na nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\\nwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.\\n\\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\\nEaster was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\\naddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\\nimportant. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was\\nexpected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not\\nmany of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would\\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\\nshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him\\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently\\ndestined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\\nMiss Lucas and herself.\\n\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\\nthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\\nin order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his\\nbow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\\nintelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his\\nrespects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\\nMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of\\nhis uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when\\nMr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen\\nthem from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running\\ninto the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\\n\\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\\nnever have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\n\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,\\nbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\\nafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\\nwho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\\naddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\\nused to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual\\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\\ncurtseyed to him without saying a word.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\\nhis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\\ngarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\\nAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\\nElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\\nway, and after a moment's pause, added:\\n\\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\\nhappened to see her there?\"\\n\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see\\nwhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between\\nthe Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he\\nanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\\nsubject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\\naway.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 31\\n\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,\\nand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures\\nof their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\\nreceived any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the\\nhouse, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\\nalmost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by\\nsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\ncome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\\nof Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the\\nParsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen\\nonly at church.\\n\\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined\\nthe party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received\\nthem civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a\\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had\\nmoreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\\ntalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\\nat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\\nwell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\\nspirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,\\nas well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a\\nwhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\\nscruple to call out:\\n\\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\\nof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\"\\n\\n\"We are speaking of music, madam,\" said he, when no longer able to avoid\\na reply.\\n\\n\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\\nmust have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.\\nThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment\\nof music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,\\nI should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health\\nhad allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed\\ndelightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.\\n\\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\\nCatherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel\\nif she does not practice a good deal.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such advice.\\nShe practises very constantly.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\\nto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\\ntell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\\nconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she\\nwill never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\\nCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\\nher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\nJenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part\\nof the house.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made\\nno answer.\\n\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\\ndrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\\ntalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away\\nfrom her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte\\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's\\ncountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\\nconvenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\n\\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\\nme? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There\\nis a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the\\nwill of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you could not\\nreally believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have\\nhad the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find\\ngreat enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are\\nnot your own.\"\\n\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\\nin meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part\\nof the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of\\ncredit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all\\nthat you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to\\nsay, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such\\nthings may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\n\\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\\n\\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried Colonel\\nFitzwilliam. \"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\"\\n\\n\"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.\\nThe first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,\\nwas at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced\\nonly four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain\\nknowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a\\npartner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\"\\n\\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\\nbeyond my own party.\"\\n\\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\\nFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I sought an\\nintroduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth, still\\naddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\\neducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend\\nhimself to strangers?\"\\n\\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without applying to\\nhim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\"\\n\\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said Darcy,\\n\"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\\ncatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\\nconcerns, as I often see done.\"\\n\\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument in the\\nmasterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same\\nforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\\nhave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the\\ntrouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as\\ncapable as any other woman's of superior execution.\"\\n\\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right. You have employed your\\ntime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\\nthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\"\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\\nwhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\\nLady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\\nto Darcy:\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\\ncould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\\nof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have\\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his\\ncousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\\ndiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\\nde Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\\nbeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\\n\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing\\nwith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\\nthem with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the\\ngentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was\\nready to take them all home.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 32\\n\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane\\nwhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\\nwhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\\nvisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to\\nbe Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her\\nhalf-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,\\nwhen the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and\\nMr. Darcy only, entered the room.\\n\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his\\nintrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were\\nto be within.\\n\\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,\\nseemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence\\nrecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and\\nfeeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\\ndeparture, she observed:\\n\\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\\nIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\\nall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\\nbefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\\n\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short\\npause added:\\n\\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\\nreturning to Netherfield again?\"\\n\\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\\nvery little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and\\nis at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\\nincreasing.\"\\n\\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for\\nthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\\nmight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\\nnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\\nfor his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same\\nprinciple.\"\\n\\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up as\\nsoon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\\ntrouble of finding a subject to him.\\n\\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very comfortable\\nhouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\\nCollins first came to Hunsford.\"\\n\\n\"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\\nkindness on a more grateful object.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one\\nof the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\\nhim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\\nI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the\\nwisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a\\nprudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\"\\n\\n\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\ndistance of her own family and friends.\"\\n\\n\"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\"\\n\\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's\\njourney. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.\"\\n\\n\"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\\nof the match,\" cried Elizabeth. \"I should never have said Mrs. Collins\\nwas settled _near_ her family.\"\\n\\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\\nthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she\\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\\nNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\n\\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\\nfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\\nvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of\\ntravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\\ncase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\\nfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\\nthe present distance.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"_You_ cannot\\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\\nbeen always at Longbourn.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\\nfeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and\\nglancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\n\\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\n\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\\ncalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\\nand her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised\\nthem. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding\\non Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying\\nmuch to anybody, went away.\\n\\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon as he was\\ngone. \"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never\\nhave called us in this familiar way.\"\\n\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\\neven to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various\\nconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\\nthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\\nfrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\\nwas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot\\nalways be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\\npleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\\ntwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\\nalmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\\naunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\\nformer favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\\nthere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,\\nshe believed he might have the best informed mind.\\n\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult\\nto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,\\nit seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice\\nto propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\\nanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\\nFitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\\nher; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect\\nof love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\\nseriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at\\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\\nlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\\nseemed nothing but absence of mind.\\n\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would\\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\\n\\n\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\\nColonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he\\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 33\\n\\n\\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\\nmischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to\\nprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that\\nit was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\\ntherefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like\\nwilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was\\nnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\\nbut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\\nnever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\\nrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about\\nher pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\\nopinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of\\nRosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\\nexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\\n_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\\nFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\\nmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed\\nher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\\npales opposite the Parsonage.\\n\\nShe was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter,\\nand dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in\\nspirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw\\non looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the\\nletter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:\\n\\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\n\\n\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I generally\\ndo every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are\\nyou going much farther?\"\\n\\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\n\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\\ntogether.\\n\\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\\n\\n\"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\\narranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\n\\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\\npleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\\nmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\\n\"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it\\nthan many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\\nfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\\ndependence.\"\\n\\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\\neither. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\\ndependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\\nwherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\"\\n\\n\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\\nexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\\nweight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where\\nthey like.\"\\n\\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\\ndo.\"\\n\\n\"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many\\nin my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\\nmoney.\"\\n\\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured at the\\nidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what\\nis the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is\\nvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\\n\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\\na silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\\nshe soon afterwards said:\\n\\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\\nhaving someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\\nlasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\\nfor the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\\nlikes with her.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he must\\ndivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\"\\n\\n\"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your\\ncharge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a\\nlittle difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\\nmay like to have her own way.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\\nin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\\ngive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\\ngot pretty near the truth. She directly replied:\\n\\n\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\\nsay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\\nvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\\nMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\"\\n\\n\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he\\nis a great friend of Darcy's.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\n\\n\"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\\nthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in\\nour journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to\\nhim. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\\nBingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\\n\\n\"What is it you mean?\"\\n\\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,\\nbecause if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an\\nunpleasant thing.\"\\n\\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\n\\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\\nBingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\\nparticulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing\\nhim the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\\n\\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\\n\\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\\nlady.\"\\n\\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\n\\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling. \"He\\nonly told me what I have now told you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\\nindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\\nwas so thoughtful.\\n\\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she. \"Your\\ncousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\"\\n\\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\n\\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\\nfriend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to\\ndetermine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.\\nBut,\" she continued, recollecting herself, \"as we know none of the\\nparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\\nthat there was much affection in the case.\"\\n\\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a\\nlessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.\"\\n\\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\\nof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and\\ntherefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent\\nmatters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\\nas soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\\nof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\\npeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\\ncould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\\nsuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\\ntaken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\\nalways attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement\\nof them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was\\nthe cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had\\nsuffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while\\nevery hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the\\nworld; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\n\\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were Colonel\\nFitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her\\nhaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\\nbusiness in London.\\n\\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility of\\nobjection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding\\nexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither\\ncould anything be urged against my father, who, though with some\\npeculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and\\nrespectability which he will probably never reach.\" When she thought of\\nher mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow\\nthat any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\npride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of\\nimportance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense;\\nand she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed\\nby this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.\\nBingley for his sister.\\n\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\\nheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to\\nher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\\ncousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\\nseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much\\nas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\\ncould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather\\ndispleased by her staying at home.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 34\\n\\n\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself\\nas much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\\nexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\\nbeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\\nrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\\nBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,\\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's\\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her\\na keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation\\nto think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the\\nnext--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should\\nherself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of\\nher spirits, by all that affection could do.\\n\\nShe could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that\\nhis cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\\nthat he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not\\nmean to be unhappy about him.\\n\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\\ndoor-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\\nthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.\\nBut this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\\naffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\\nroom. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\\nShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\\nthen getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\\nsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\\nin an agitated manner, and thus began:\\n\\n\"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\\nrepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\\nyou.\"\\n\\nElizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\\ndoubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;\\nand the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,\\nimmediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides\\nthose of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the\\nsubject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of\\nits being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always\\nopposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to\\nthe consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\\nsuit.\\n\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\\nthe compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\\nnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\\nreceive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she\\nlost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\\nanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite\\nof all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\\nhis hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt\\nof a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but\\nhis countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could\\nonly exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her\\ncheeks, and she said:\\n\\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\\nunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should\\nbe felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\\ncannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\\nbestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\\nanyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\\nof short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\\nthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\\novercoming it after this explanation.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed\\non her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\\nsurprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance\\nof his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\\nappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\\nhimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings\\ndreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\\n\\n\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!\\nI might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\\ncivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\"\\n\\n\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \"why with so evident a desire\\nof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\\nagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\\nWas not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\\nother provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against\\nyou--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you\\nthink that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\\nbeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most\\nbeloved sister?\"\\n\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\\nwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\\ncontinued:\\n\\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\\nexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\\nyou cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means\\nof dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the\\nworld for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for\\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\\nkind.\"\\n\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\\nwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\\nHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\\n\\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\\n\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of denying\\nthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\\nkinder than towards myself.\"\\n\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\\nbut its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\\n\\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my dislike\\nis founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was\\ndecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\\nmany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\\nsay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\\nor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\\n\\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,\" said Darcy,\\nin a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\n\\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an\\ninterest in him?\"\\n\\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his misfortunes\\nhave been great indeed.\"\\n\\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy. \"You have reduced\\nhim to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have\\nwithheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for\\nhim. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence\\nwhich was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!\\nand yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and\\nridicule.\"\\n\\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\\n\"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!\\nI thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\\ncalculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\" added he, stopping in\\nhis walk, and turning towards her, \"these offenses might have been\\noverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\\nscruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\\nbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of\\nmy being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\\nreflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\\nNor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and\\njust. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\\nconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose\\ncondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\\nthe utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\n\\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\\ndeclaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern\\nwhich I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more\\ngentlemanlike manner.\"\\n\\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\\n\\n\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that\\nwould have tempted me to accept it.\"\\n\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\\nexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:\\n\\n\"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of\\nmy acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest\\nbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of\\nthe feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of\\ndisapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\\ndislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\\nlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\n\\n\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\\nfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\\nForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\\nwishes for your health and happiness.\"\\n\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\\nthe next moment open the front door and quit the house.\\n\\nThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how\\nto support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for\\nhalf-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,\\nwas increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of\\nmarriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for\\nso many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of\\nall the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying\\nher sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his\\nown case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired\\nunconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable\\npride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to\\nJane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could\\nnot justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.\\nWickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon\\novercame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for\\na moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the\\nsound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to\\nencounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 35\\n\\n\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\\nwhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\\nsurprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything\\nelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after\\nbreakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's\\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\\nshe turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The\\npark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\\nof the gates into the ground.\\n\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\\nlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\\nmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\\nverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,\\nwhen she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\\nedged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.\\nDarcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now\\nnear enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\\nher name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though\\nin a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the\\ngate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,\\nwhich she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,\\n\"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.\\nWill you do me the honour of reading that letter?\" And then, with a\\nslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\\n\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\\nElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written\\nquite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\\nfull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\\nfrom Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\\n\\n\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension\\nof its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those\\noffers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\\nintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes\\nwhich, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\\neffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\\nshould have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\\nand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\\ndemand it of your justice.\\n\\n\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\\nmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\\nthat, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\\nfrom your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\\nclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\\nprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\\nwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\\nits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\\npersons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\\nbear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\\nnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\\nto be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions\\nand their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which\\nis due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\\nmay be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity\\nmust be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\\n\\n\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\\nothers, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young\\nwoman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance\\nat Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious\\nattachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I\\nhad the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir\\nWilliam Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to\\nyour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.\\nHe spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could\\nbe undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour\\nattentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss\\nBennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also\\nwatched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,\\nbut without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced\\nfrom the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions\\nwith pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\\nsentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been\\nin error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter\\nprobable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict\\npain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not\\nscruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and\\nair was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\\nthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\\neasily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is\\ncertain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions\\nare not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe\\nher to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial\\nconviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the\\nmarriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have\\nthe utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of\\nconnection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But\\nthere were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still\\nexisting, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had\\nmyself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before\\nme. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your\\nmother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that\\ntotal want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by\\nherself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your\\nfather. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern\\nfor the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\nrepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to\\nhave conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,\\nis praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than\\nit is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say\\nfarther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties\\nwas confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led\\nme before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\nconnection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as\\nyou, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.\\n\\n\"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness\\nhad been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was\\nsoon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in\\ndetaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in\\nLondon. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office\\nof pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I\\ndescribed, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance\\nmight have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\\nthat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\\nseconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your\\nsister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his\\naffection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\\nnatural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his\\nown. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was\\nno very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into\\nHertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the\\nwork of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There\\nis but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not\\nreflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the\\nmeasures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in\\ntown. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her\\nbrother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without\\nill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me\\nenough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this\\nconcealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it\\nwas done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no\\nother apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it\\nwas unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to\\nyou very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\\nthem.\\n\\n\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured\\nMr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his\\nconnection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I\\nam ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more\\nthan one witness of undoubted veracity.\\n\\n\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many\\nyears the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good\\nconduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to\\nbe of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his\\nkindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at\\nschool, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his\\nown father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have\\nbeen unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only\\nfond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he\\nhad also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be\\nhis profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is\\nmany, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different\\nmanner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was\\ncareful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\\nthe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,\\nand who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.\\nDarcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree\\nyou only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham\\nhas created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from\\nunfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.\\n\\n\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to\\nMr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly\\nrecommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner\\nthat his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a\\nvaluable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There\\nwas also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long\\nsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham\\nwrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,\\nhe hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more\\nimmediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he\\ncould not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying\\nlaw, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\\nbe a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed\\nhim to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to\\nhis proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the\\nbusiness was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance\\nin the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\\nreceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\\nbetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\\nto Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly\\nlived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free\\nfrom all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.\\nFor about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\\nincumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to\\nme again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured\\nme, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He\\nhad found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\\nresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in\\nquestion--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was\\nwell assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not\\nhave forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame\\nme for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every\\nrepetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of\\nhis circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\\nto others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every\\nappearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But\\nlast summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\n\\n\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,\\nand which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold\\nto any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your\\nsecrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to\\nthe guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.\\nAbout a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed\\nfor her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided\\nover it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by\\ndesign; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him\\nand Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and\\nby her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\\nwhose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to\\nher as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and\\nto consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her\\nexcuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed\\nthe knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two\\nbefore the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\\nidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as\\na father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and\\nhow I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented\\nany public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place\\nimmediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.\\nWickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which\\nis thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of\\nrevenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have\\nbeen complete indeed.\\n\\n\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have\\nbeen concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as\\nfalse, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.\\nWickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he\\nhad imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered\\nat. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,\\ndetection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in\\nyour inclination.\\n\\n\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but\\nI was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to\\nbe revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more\\nparticularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our\\nnear relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of\\nthe executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted\\nwith every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_\\nshould make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by\\nthe same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be\\nthe possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some\\nopportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the\\nmorning. I will only add, God bless you.\\n\\n\"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 36\\n\\n\\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\\ncontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\\nits contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly\\nshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\\nHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\\nand steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\nto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\\nprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what\\nhad happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly\\nleft her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the\\nnext sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of\\nthe one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she\\ninstantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst\\nobjections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing\\nhim justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied\\nher; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and\\ninsolence.\\n\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\\nshe read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,\\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\\nbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her\\nfeelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\\nto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\\nThis cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\"--and when she had\\ngone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the\\nlast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\\nregard it, that she would never look in it again.\\n\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter\\nwas unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she\\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\\nThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what\\nhe had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though\\nshe had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own\\nwords. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the\\nwill, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\\nwas fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\\nimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\\nother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\\nnot err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the\\nparticulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions\\nto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down\\nthe letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\\nlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read\\non; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\\nbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\\nrender Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\\nturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\n\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at\\nMr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\\nbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\\nentrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the\\npersuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\\nhad there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life\\nnothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As\\nto his real character, had information been in her power, she had\\nnever felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had\\nestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried\\nto recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of\\nintegrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of\\nMr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those\\ncasual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy\\nhad described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But\\nno such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before\\nher, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more\\nsubstantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After\\npausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to\\nread. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss\\nDarcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel\\nFitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was\\nreferred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam\\nhimself--from whom she had previously received the information of his\\nnear concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no\\nreason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and\\nat length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never\\nhave hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\\ncousin's corroboration.\\n\\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation\\nbetween Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.\\nMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\\nstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\\nwondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\\nhimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\\nwith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\\nof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\\n_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\\nthe very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield\\nfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\\nherself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;\\nthat he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's\\ncharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\\nalways prevent his exposing the son.\\n\\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!\\nHis attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\\nhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\\nthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\\nHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had\\neither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\\nincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\\nand fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\\nbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as\\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\\nacquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\\nof irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was\\nesteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\\nsister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his\\nactions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\\neverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\\nthat friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man\\nas Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\\n\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\\ncould she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,\\nabsurd.\\n\\n\"How despicably I have acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have prided myself\\non my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have\\noften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified\\nmy vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this\\ndiscovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could\\nnot have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my\\nfolly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\\nof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were\\nconcerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.\"\\n\\nFrom herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\\nwhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation\\n_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely\\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\\ncredit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to\\ngive in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her\\nsister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's\\nopinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his\\ndescription of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were\\nlittle displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air\\nand manner not often united with great sensibility.\\n\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\nmentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense\\nof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\\nfor denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as\\nhaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\\nthan on hers.\\n\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,\\nbut it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been\\nself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered\\nthat Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest\\nrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\\nby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\\nhad ever known before.\\n\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\\nvariety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,\\nand reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and\\nso important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made\\nher at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish\\nof appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such\\nreflections as must make her unfit for conversation.\\n\\nShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\\ncalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take\\nleave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\\nan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\\ntill she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern\\nin missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\\nlonger an object; she could think only of her letter.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 37\\n\\n\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having\\nbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\\nable to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very\\ngood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\\nmelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then\\nhastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,\\nimporting that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\\nhaving them all to dine with her.\\n\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had\\nshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as\\nher future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\\nladyship's indignation would have been. \"What would she have said? how\\nwould she have behaved?\" were questions with which she amused herself.\\n\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. \"I assure\\nyou, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I believe no one\\nfeels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly\\nattached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to\\nme! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The\\ndear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy\\nseemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His\\nattachment to Rosings certainly increases.\"\\n\\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which\\nwere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\n\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\\nspirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that\\nshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added:\\n\\n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that\\nyou may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your\\ncompany, I am sure.\"\\n\\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\" replied\\nElizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town\\nnext Saturday.\"\\n\\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected\\nyou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There\\ncan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly\\nspare you for another fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters\\nare never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay\\nanother _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as\\nfar as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as\\nDawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room\\nfor one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I\\nshould not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\"\\n\\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\\noriginal plan.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned. \"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant\\nwith them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea\\nof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.\\nYou must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in\\nthe world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly\\nguarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my\\nniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\\nhaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of\\nMr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\\npropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\\nthings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I\\nam glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be\\ndiscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.\"\\n\\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you\\nhave somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?\\nOh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be\\nattended to.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,\\nand as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,\\nwhich Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so\\noccupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be\\nreserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it\\nas the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary\\nwalk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant\\nrecollections.\\n\\nMr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She\\nstudied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\\ntimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\\nshe was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly\\nshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\\nherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\\nHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she\\ncould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,\\nor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\\nbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in\\nthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\\nThey were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\\nthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\\nyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently\\nunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\\nand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,\\nwhat chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\\nirritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always\\naffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\\nscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While\\nthere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\\nMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there\\nforever.\\n\\nAnxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's\\nexplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,\\nheightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved\\nto have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any\\ncould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How\\ngrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every\\nrespect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\n\\nWhen to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's\\ncharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\\nseldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it\\nalmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\\n\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of\\nher stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent\\nthere; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of\\ntheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,\\nand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right\\nway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the\\nwork of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\\n\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them\\na good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;\\nand Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her\\nhand to both.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 38\\n\\n\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few\\nminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of\\npaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\\n\\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs. Collins has yet\\nexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very\\ncertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for\\nit. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We\\nknow how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain\\nmanner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we\\nsee of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\\nyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,\\nand that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending\\nyour time unpleasantly.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She\\nhad spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with\\nCharlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_\\nfeel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling\\nsolemnity replied:\\n\\n\"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not\\ndisagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately\\nhaving it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,\\nfrom our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the\\nhumble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford\\nvisit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to\\nLady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage\\nand blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You\\nsee how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge\\nthat, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should\\nnot think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are\\nsharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\\n\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was\\nobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility\\nand truth in a few short sentences.\\n\\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will\\nbe able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you\\nhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear\\nthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be\\nas well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\\nthat I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\\nmarriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of\\nthinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\\ncharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each\\nother.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was\\nthe case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed\\nand rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to\\nhave the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.\\nPoor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she\\nhad chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that\\nher visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her\\nhome and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their\\ndependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\n\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels\\nplaced within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate\\nparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by\\nMr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her\\nwith his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks\\nfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her\\nin, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,\\nwhen he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\\nhitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.\\n\\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your humble respects\\ndelivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you\\nwhile you have been here.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and\\nthe carriage drove off.\\n\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, \"it seems\\nbut a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have\\nhappened!\"\\n\\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\\n\\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!\\nHow much I shall have to tell!\"\\n\\nElizabeth added privately, \"And how much I shall have to conceal!\"\\n\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and\\nwithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's\\nhouse, where they were to remain a few days.\\n\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her\\nspirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her\\naunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at\\nLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\\n\\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for\\nLongbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know\\nthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish\\nJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own\\nvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation\\nto openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision\\nin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;\\nand her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried\\ninto repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister\\nfurther.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 39\\n\\n\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out\\ntogether from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;\\nand, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage\\nwas to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's\\npunctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.\\nThese two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed\\nin visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and\\ndressing a salad and cucumber.\\n\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set\\nout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,\\n\"Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?\"\\n\\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia, \"but you must lend us the\\nmoney, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.\" Then, showing\\nher purchases--\"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think\\nit is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall\\npull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any\\nbetter.\"\\n\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\nunconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\\nwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\\nthink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\\none wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\\nare going in a fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"Are they indeed!\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\n\\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to\\ntake us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;\\nand I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to\\ngo too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall\\nhave!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,\\nand completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole\\ncampful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor\\nregiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!\"\\n\\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they sat down at\\ntable. \"What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about\\na certain person we all like!\"\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need\\nnot stay. Lydia laughed, and said:\\n\\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the\\nwaiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse\\nthings said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\\nhe is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\\nmy news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?\\nThere is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She\\nis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\"\\n\\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a connection\\nimprudent as to fortune.\"\\n\\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\\n\\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said Jane.\\n\\n\"I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared\\nthree straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled\\nthing?\"\\n\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\ncoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_\\nwas little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!\\n\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\nordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\\nboxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and\\nLydia's purchases, were seated in it.\\n\\n\"How nicely we are all crammed in,\" cried Lydia. \"I am glad I bought my\\nbonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now\\nlet us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way\\nhome. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all\\nsince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\\nflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\\nbefore you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\nShe is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not\\nbeing married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to\\nget husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\\nCollins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\\nhow I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would\\nchaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\\nof fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend\\nthe day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\\nevening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\\nshe asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\\nwas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\\ndressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a\\nlady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\\nForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\\none of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\\nand Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\\ndid not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.\\nForster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\\nsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\"\\n\\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\nLydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\\ncompanions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\\ncould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.\\n\\nTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\\nin undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\\nsay voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\n\\n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\n\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\\ncame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that\\noccupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and\\npoultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one\\nhand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat\\nsome way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger\\nLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's,\\nwas enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who\\nwould hear her.\\n\\n\"Oh! Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\\nAs we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there\\nwas nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty\\nhad not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved\\nvery handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold\\nluncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated\\nyou too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never\\nshould have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then\\nwe were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that\\nanybody might have heard us ten miles off!\"\\n\\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear sister,\\nto depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the\\ngenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\\n_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.\"\\n\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\\nanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\\n\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk\\nto Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily\\nopposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could\\nnot be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.\\nThere was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.\\nWickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The\\ncomfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond\\nexpression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped\\nthere could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\n\\nShe had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton\\nscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\\nfrequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\\nfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\\nat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 40\\n\\n\\nElizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could\\nno longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every\\nparticular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be\\nsurprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene\\nbetween Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n\\nMiss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly\\npartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly\\nnatural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was\\nsorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\\nlittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\\nunhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.\\n\\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she, \"and certainly\\nought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his\\ndisappointment!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\\nother feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\\nYou do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\"\\n\\n\"Blame you! Oh, no.\"\\n\\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\"\\n\\n\"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\"\\n\\n\"But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next\\nday.\"\\n\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\\nas they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!\\nwho would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\\nso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here\\ncollected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though\\ngrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\\nMost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\\nseek to clear the one without involving the other.\\n\\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able to make both\\nof them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\\nwith only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\\nenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\\nabout pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;\\nbut you shall do as you choose.\"\\n\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\\n\\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she. \"Wickham so\\nvery bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only\\nconsider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the\\nknowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing\\nof his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it\\nso.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so\\nfull of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am\\ngrowing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion\\nmakes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will\\nbe as light as a feather.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\"\\n\\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\\ntwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the\\nappearance of it.\"\\n\\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\\nused to do.\"\\n\\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\\nto him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an\\nopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\\nabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing\\nat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\\nthe matter as you do now.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And\\nwith no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say\\nthat I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I\\nhad! Oh! how I wanted you!\"\\n\\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\\nin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\\nundeserved.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\\nnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There\\nis one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\\nought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand\\nWickham's character.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there can be no\\noccasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?\"\\n\\n\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me\\nto make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\\nrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\\nmyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\\nconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy\\nis so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in\\nMeryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal\\nto it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\\nanyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,\\nand then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At\\npresent I will say nothing about it.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\\never. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\\nre-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\"\\n\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had\\ngot rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,\\nand was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish\\nto talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,\\nof which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other\\nhalf of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she\\nhad been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one\\ncould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\\nunderstanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off\\nthis last encumbrance of mystery. \"And then,\" said she, \"if that very\\nimprobable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to\\ntell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The\\nliberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!\"\\n\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real\\nstate of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a\\nvery tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself\\nin love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,\\nand, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first\\nattachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,\\nand prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her\\nattention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the\\nindulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own\\nhealth and their tranquillity.\\n\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion _now_ of\\nthis sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak\\nof it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But\\nI cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is\\na very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least\\nchance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of\\nhis coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of\\neverybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\n\\n\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I\\nshall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I\\nwould not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will\\ndie of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\"\\n\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,\\nshe made no answer.\\n\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother, soon afterwards, \"and so the\\nCollinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope\\nit will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an\\nexcellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her\\nmother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_\\nhousekeeping, I dare say.\"\\n\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\\n\\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will\\ntake care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed\\nfor money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\\ntalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as\\nquite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\n\\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\n\\n\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they\\noften talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an\\nestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be\\nashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 41\\n\\n\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was\\nthe last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies\\nin the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\\nuniversal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\\nand sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very\\nfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and\\nLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\\n\\n\"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?\" would they\\noften exclaim in the bitterness of woe. \"How can you be smiling so,\\nLizzy?\"\\n\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what\\nshe had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years\\nago.\\n\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when Colonel\\nMiller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I shall break _mine_,\" said Lydia.\\n\\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so\\ndisagreeable.\"\\n\\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\"\\n\\n\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\"\\nadded Kitty.\\n\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\\nLongbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense\\nof pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's\\nobjections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his\\ninterference in the views of his friend.\\n\\nBut the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she\\nreceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of\\nthe regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a\\nvery young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour\\nand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\\ntheir _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\\n\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\\nthe delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\\nto be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia\\nflew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's\\ncongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\\nwhilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate\\nin terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\\n\\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\"\\nsaid she, \"Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much\\nright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\"\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\\nher resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\\nexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\\nconsidered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense\\nfor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it\\nknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\\ngo. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general\\nbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\\nsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\\nbe greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:\\n\\n\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public\\nplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so\\nlittle expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\\ncircumstances.\"\\n\\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great disadvantage to\\nus all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and\\nimprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\\nwould judge differently in the affair.\"\\n\\n\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet. \"What, has she frightened away\\nsome of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such\\nsqueamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity\\nare not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who\\nhave been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\\nof particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\\nimportance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the\\nwild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\\nLydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\\nfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\\nof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\\nher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\\nwill be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\nthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\\nyouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness\\nof her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\\ncontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger\\nKitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\\nignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you\\nsuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\\ndisgrace?\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\naffectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\n\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known\\nyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\\nadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\\nsisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\\nBrighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\\nkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\\nobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\\neven as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\\nwomen better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\\nthere may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\\nmany degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest\\nof her life.\"\\n\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\\ncontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\\nin her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on\\nthem. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret\\nover unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\\ndisposition.\\n\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\\nfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\\nunited volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\\nevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye\\nof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\\nShe saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them\\nat present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents\\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\\nand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\\nsaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\\nofficers at once.\\n\\nHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such\\nrealities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have\\nbeen understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.\\nLydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy\\nconviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.\\n\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\\ncontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving\\nhome.\\n\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\\nfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\\nwell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\\nlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted\\nher, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\\nfinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\\ngallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\\nreproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\\ncause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\\nand her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\\n\\nOn the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,\\nwith other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\\ndisposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some\\ninquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\\nmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three\\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\\n\\nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's\\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\\nhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\\nasked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\\nWith an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:\\n\\n\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\\n\\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\n\\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\n\\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin's.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. \"And\\npray, may I ask?--\" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, \"Is\\nit in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility\\nto his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,\" he continued in a lower\\nand more serious tone, \"that he is improved in essentials.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth. \"In essentials, I believe, he is very much\\nwhat he ever was.\"\\n\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\\nrejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a\\nsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\\nand anxious attention, while she added:\\n\\n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\\nhis mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from\\nknowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\"\\n\\nWickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\\nlook; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his\\nembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\\naccents:\\n\\n\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\\ncomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\\neven the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\\nmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only\\ndeter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only\\nfear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been\\nalluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good\\nopinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always\\noperated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be\\nimputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I\\nam certain he has very much at heart.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\\nslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\\nthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\\nhim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his\\nside, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\\nmutual desire of never meeting again.\\n\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\\nfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\\nbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\\nonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\\nBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\\nand impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which\\nthere was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in\\nthe clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more\\ngentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 42\\n\\n\\nHad Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\\nnot have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic\\ncomfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\\nof good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\\nwoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\\ntheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\\nesteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views\\nof domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of\\na disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\\nimprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often\\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\\nthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\\nenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as\\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\n\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\\nfather's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\\nstrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\\nunsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\\nfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\\nif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\n\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little\\nother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\\nabroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and\\nsister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around\\nthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\\nmight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\\ngreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all\\nher folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\nwatering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\\nhas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been\\nlooking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the\\nsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\\nname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have\\nsome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\\nagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\\npresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\\nwas now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\\nfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\\nand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\\nscheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\\n\\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish for.\\nWere the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\\nBut here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my\\nsister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\\npleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\\nnever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\\nthe defence of some little peculiar vexation.\"\\n\\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\\nto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\\nalways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\\nthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\\nhad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\\nmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\\nviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to\\nthe camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still\\nless to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were\\nmuch too full of lines under the words to be made public.\\n\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good\\nhumour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore\\na happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came\\nback again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet\\nwas restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of\\nJune, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without\\ntears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by\\nthe following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to\\nmention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious\\narrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in\\nMeryton.\\n\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\\napproaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\\narrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\\ncurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\\nsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\\nwithin a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so\\nfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the\\npresent plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that\\ncounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\\nweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\\nher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\\nDovedale, or the Peak.\\n\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing\\nthe Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\\nwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\\nand all was soon right again.\\n\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was\\nimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\\nowner. \"But surely,\" said she, \"I may enter his county with impunity,\\nand rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\n\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\\nbefore her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.\\nand Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\\nLongbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\\nyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their\\ncousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\\nsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\\nway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\n\\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the\\nnext morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.\\nOne enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;\\na suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\\ninconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\\nand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\\ndisappointments abroad.\\n\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\\nnor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\\nlay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are\\nsufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\\nconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's\\nformer residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance\\nstill remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the\\nprincipal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,\\nElizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not\\nin their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed\\nan inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\\nwillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\\n\\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard\\nso much?\" said her aunt; \"a place, too, with which so many of your\\nacquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\\nknow.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\\nmust own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so\\nmany, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \"If it were merely a fine house\\nrichly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it myself; but\\nthe grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\\ncountry.\"\\n\\nElizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The\\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\\noccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and\\nthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such\\na risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\\nthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the\\nabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.\\n\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\\nwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its\\nproprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\\nthe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her\\nalarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\\nnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\\nwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\\nto the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 43\\n\\n\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\\nPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\\nin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\\n\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\\nentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\\na beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\n\\nElizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\\nevery remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\\nhalf-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\\neminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\\nPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which\\nthe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\\nbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of\\nhigh woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was\\nswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\\nwere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\\nhad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\\nbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\\nall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\\nto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\\n\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\\nwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\\nmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\\nmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\\nwonder at her being where she was.\\n\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less\\nfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\\nfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned\\nroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\\nto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which\\nthey had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\\nwas a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and\\nshe looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its\\nbanks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,\\nwith delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking\\ndifferent positions; but from every window there were beauties to be\\nseen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to\\nthe fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of\\nhis taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\\nsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\n\\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress! With\\nthese rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\\nviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\\nwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,\"--recollecting\\nherself--\"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\\nme; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\\n\\nThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like\\nregret.\\n\\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really\\nabsent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question\\nwas asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.\\nReynolds replied that he was, adding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with\\na large party of friends.\" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own\\njourney had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\n\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the\\nlikeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,\\nover the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\\nThe housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young\\ngentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought\\nup by him at his own expense. \"He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\\n\"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\\nreturn it.\\n\\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\\n\"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\\nother--about eight years ago.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard much of your master's fine person,\" said Mrs. Gardiner,\\nlooking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\\nus whether it is like or not.\"\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\nintimation of her knowing her master.\\n\\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\\n\\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you\\nwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\\nmaster's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\\nbe then. He was very fond of them.\"\\n\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\\nwhen she was only eight years old.\\n\\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\n\\n\"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\\naccomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is\\na new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she\\ncomes here to-morrow with him.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her\\ncommunicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either\\nby pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\\nmaster and his sister.\\n\\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\n\\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his\\ntime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\"\\n\\n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\n\\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\\ngood enough for him.\"\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \"It is\\nvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\"\\n\\n\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,\"\\nreplied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she\\nlistened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, \"I have\\nnever known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever\\nsince he was four years old.\"\\n\\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\\nideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\\nHer keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was\\ngrateful to her uncle for saying:\\n\\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\\nhaving such a master.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could\\nnot meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and\\nhe was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\\nworld.\"\\n\\nElizabeth almost stared at her. \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\" thought she.\\n\\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\n\\n\"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\\nas affable to the poor.\"\\n\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\\nReynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\\nof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\\nfurniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\\nprejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\\nmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\\nmany merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\\n\\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that ever\\nlived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but\\nthemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give\\nhim a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw\\nanything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away\\nlike other young men.\"\\n\\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked, \"is not\\nquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\n\\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\n\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty\\nsitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\\nthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\\ngive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when\\nlast at Pemberley.\\n\\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\\none of the windows.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter\\nthe room. \"And this is always the way with him,\" she added. \"Whatever\\ncan give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There\\nis nothing he would not do for her.\"\\n\\nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were\\nall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;\\nbut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\\nvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\\nDarcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\\nalso more intelligible.\\n\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\\nlittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of\\nthe only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested\\nher--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a\\nsmile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he\\nlooked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest\\ncontemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.\\nMrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's\\nlifetime.\\n\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle\\nsensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of\\ntheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\\nwas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\\nof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\\nconsidered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how\\nmuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of\\ngood or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought\\nforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\\nstood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his\\neyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\\ngratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\\nsoftened its impropriety of expression.\\n\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\\nthey returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.\\n\\nAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former\\nwas conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\\nsuddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\\n\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his\\nappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\\ninstantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest\\nblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\\nsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\\nand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\\nof perfect civility.\\n\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\\novercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\\nthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on\\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer\\nshe returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\\nalteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that\\nhe uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\\nimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\\nminutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\\nher life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent\\nhad none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as\\nto the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in\\nDerbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\\ndistraction of his thoughts.\\n\\nAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\\nmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\\nleave.\\n\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but\\nElizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,\\nfollowed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her\\ncoming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the\\nworld! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light\\nmight it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely\\nthrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he\\nthus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\\nsooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;\\nfor it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted\\nfrom his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over\\nthe perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly\\naltered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was\\namazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!\\nNever in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never\\nhad he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What\\na contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put\\nhis letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account\\nfor it.\\n\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\\nevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\\nreach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time\\nbefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\\nmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and\\nseemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\\ndistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\\nwas. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in\\nwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\\nshe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\\nfelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\\nnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\\nseeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\\ncomposure.\\n\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\\naroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\\n\\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\\nascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of\\nthe trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the\\nvalley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading\\nmany, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\\nof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.\\nWith a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.\\nIt settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which\\nbrought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,\\nto the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed\\nit by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;\\nit was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\\nvalley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\\nand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\\nElizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the\\nbridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only\\nof returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\\nprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\\noccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the\\nman about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment\\nwas quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\\napproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here\\nless sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\nthey met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared\\nfor an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\\nlasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\\nturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw\\nthat he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\\npoliteness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\\nbut she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when\\nsome unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\\nPemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,\\nand she said no more.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\\nher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\\nThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;\\nand she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\\nacquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had\\nrevolted in his offer to herself. \"What will be his surprise,\" thought\\nshe, \"when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of\\nfashion.\"\\n\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\\nrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\\nit, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\\ncould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\\nconnection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and\\nso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\\ncould not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had\\nsome relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\\nexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\\nhis taste, or his good manners.\\n\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\\nchose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time\\nto supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\\nthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\\nwalking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.\\nElizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\\nmust be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\\ncontinually was she repeating, \"Why is he so altered? From what can\\nit proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his\\nmanners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a\\nchange as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\"\\n\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to\\nthe brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\\nwater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated\\nin Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\\nElizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\\nher husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\\ntogether. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him\\nto know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\\nplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\\nvery unexpected--\"for your housekeeper,\" she added, \"informed us that\\nyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we\\nleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected\\nin the country.\" He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\\nbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \"They\\nwill join me early to-morrow,\" he continued, \"and among them are some\\nwho will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\\n\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\\ndriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last\\nmentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_\\nmind was not very differently engaged.\\n\\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after a\\npause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\\nme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\\nduring your stay at Lambton?\"\\n\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\\nfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\\nthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her\\nmust be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was\\nsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\\nhim think really ill of her.\\n\\nThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\\nwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\\npleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\\nthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had\\nreached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\\nmile behind.\\n\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\\ntired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\\nhave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\\nthere seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected\\nthat she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale\\nwith great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her\\npatience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was\\nover. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go\\ninto the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and\\nthey parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\\nladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\\nwalking slowly towards the house.\\n\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\\npronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\\n\"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\" said her uncle.\\n\\n\"There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,\" replied her\\naunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\\nsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I\\nhave seen nothing of it.\"\\n\\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\\nthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\\nattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as Wickham;\\nor, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features\\nare perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so\\ndisagreeable?\"\\n\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked\\nhim better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never\\nseen him so pleasant as this morning.\\n\\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\" replied\\nher uncle. \"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\\nat his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off\\nhis grounds.\"\\n\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but\\nsaid nothing.\\n\\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I really\\nshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\\nanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\\nOn the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\\nspeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would\\nnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\\ngood lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\\nmaster, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every\\nvirtue.\"\\n\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\\nhis behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in\\nas guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from\\nhis relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\\nWickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\\nconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\\napproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\\nthe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\\nto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of\\nanything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they\\nhad no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a\\nintercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.\\n\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above\\nall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 44\\n\\n\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\\nher the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\\nBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their\\narrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\\nplace with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn\\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in\\na curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing\\nthe livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\\nsurprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she\\nexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\\nthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that\\nthere was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a\\nquarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\\nnewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\\nElizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite\\namazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,\\nshe dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much\\nin her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\\nsuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\\n\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\\ninquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\\n\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\\ntook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\\nonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\\nher beyond a monosyllable.\\n\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\\nwomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there\\nwas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.\\n\\nThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley\\nwas also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick\\nstep was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\\nElizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\\nfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\\ncordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\\ninquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked\\nand spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\n\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\\nthan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\\nthem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\\narisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards\\neach with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\\nthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew\\nwhat it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little\\nin doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\\nevident enough.\\n\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\\nfeelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and\\nto make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\\nendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\\nwas ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\n\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!\\nhow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in\\na like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\\nformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\\nthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\\nthough this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\\nbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look\\nappeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred\\nbetween them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point\\nshe was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred\\nere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\\nrecollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying\\nmore that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed\\nto her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone\\nwhich had something of real regret, that it \"was a very long time since\\nhe had had the pleasure of seeing her;\" and, before she could reply,\\nhe added, \"It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of\\nNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\\n_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\\nnor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\\ngave them meaning.\\n\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;\\nbut, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed\\nfrom _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\\nthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\\ntemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\\nshe saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion\\nof people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\\ndisgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\\nvery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\\nlively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was\\nso great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\\nrestrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\\nof his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\\nat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance\\ncould result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw\\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\\nRosings.\\n\\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose\\nto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\\ntheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\\nat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\\ndiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\\nhow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,\\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\\nsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\\n\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on\\nthis account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\\nvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some\\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\\nlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\\nuncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\n\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was\\nnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\\nmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\\nit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\\ninterest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\\n\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\\nnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\\nfrom their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference\\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\\nwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\\nthat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\\nhastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\\ntheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\\nnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\\nit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town\\nwhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\\nwas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\\n\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\\nson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\\nhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\\n\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;\\nand she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She\\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened\\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\\nhis favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\\nthere was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\\nIt was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,\\nbut for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and\\nacrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\\naccompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid\\nher as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most\\neager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display\\nof regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only\\nwere concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent\\non making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much\\npride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent\\nlove, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a\\nsort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\\nexactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\\nshe felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\\nfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would\\nbe for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her\\nfancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of\\nhis addresses.\\n\\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that\\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the\\nvery day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a\\nlate breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,\\nby some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that\\nit would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\\nshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\\nrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\\nsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 45\\n\\n\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had\\noriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her\\nappearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how\\nmuch civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.\\n\\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\\nwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows\\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\\n\\nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\\nLondon. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with\\nall the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear\\nof doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior\\nthe belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\\nhowever, did her justice, and pitied her.\\n\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,\\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\\nof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\\nshort sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\\n\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\\nof saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\\nfeared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss\\nBingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\\ninquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\\n\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many\\na significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\\nparty--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\\nthem round the table.\\n\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\\nregret that he came.\\n\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\\nonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\\nGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely\\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more\\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's\\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded\\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\n\\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?\\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.\"\\n\\nIn Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\\nbut exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\\npresently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While\\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened\\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would\\nhave refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\\nElizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\\nDarcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\\nand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected\\nwith that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's\\nmeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections\\nher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very\\nwish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\\nfor the welfare of his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\\nrecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\n\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\\nmentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss\\nBingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,\\nbehaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's\\nrecommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not\\nerr. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana\\nwithout the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When\\nDarcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to\\nhim some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\\n\\n\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\" she\\ncried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since\\nthe winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing\\nthat we should not have known her again.\"\\n\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\\nhimself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than\\nher being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\\nsummer.\\n\\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could\\nsee any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose\\nwants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,\\nwhich have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything\\nextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do\\nnot like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency\\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.\"\\n\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\\nsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a\\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued:\\n\\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_\\na beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she\\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\\none time.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but _that_\\nwas only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have\\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\\n\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\\nvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\\nboth. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\\nexcept of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but\\nhimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\\nhim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's\\nbeginning the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 46\\n\\n\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\\nJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been\\nrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but\\non the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the\\nreceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\\nit had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\\nJane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\n\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and\\nher uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\\nthemselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been\\nwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\\nlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\\nbut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\\nagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:\\n\\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\\nmost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\\nassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\\nAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\\nfrom Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\\nwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\\nsurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\\nvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\\nto hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\\nThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step\\n(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\\ndisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\\nOur poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\\nthankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against\\nhim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\\ntwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\\neight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\\npassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\\nhim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\\ntheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\\nmother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\\nknow what I have written.\"\\n\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\\nwhat she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the\\nother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\\nhad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\\n\\n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I\\nwish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\\nhead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\\nLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\\nand it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham\\nand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\\ntaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\\nto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\\nday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short\\nletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\\nGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\\nnever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was\\nrepeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.\\nintending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,\\nbut no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\\ncoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that\\nis known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.\\nI know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that\\nside London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing\\nthem at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but\\nwithout any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With\\nthe kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\\nto us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved\\nfor him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our\\ndistress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the\\nworst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make\\nit more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue\\ntheir first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a\\nyoung woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose\\nher so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that\\nColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his\\nhead when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to\\nbe trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she\\nexert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And\\nas to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has\\nanger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of\\nconfidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\\nhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the\\nfirst shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not\\nso selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I\\ntake up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but\\ncircumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to\\ncome here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,\\nthat I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something\\nmore to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel\\nForster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure\\nI know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any\\nmeasure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to\\nbe at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my\\nuncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will\\nimmediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing\\na moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was\\nopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous\\nmanner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,\\nshe, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,\\nhastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find\\nMr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not\\nan instant to lose.\"\\n\\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling than\\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute;\\nbut let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\\nnot well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\\n\\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how\\nlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\\nthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless\\nan accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\\nmistress home instantly.\\n\\nOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and\\nlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\\nor to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\\n\"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\\npresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\"\\n\\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \"There\\nis nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by\\nsome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\"\\n\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\\nnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\\nsomething indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate\\nsilence. At length she spoke again. \"I have just had a letter from Jane,\\nwith such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger\\nsister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into\\nthe power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.\\n_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no\\nconnections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.\"\\n\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment. \"When I consider,\" she added in a yet\\nmore agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what\\nhe was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I\\nlearnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not\\nhave happened. But it is all--all too late now.\"\\n\\n\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved--shocked. But is it\\ncertain--absolutely certain?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\\nalmost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to\\nScotland.\"\\n\\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\"\\n\\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's\\nimmediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But\\nnothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\\nsuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\\nnot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\"\\n\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\n\\n\"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what\\nI ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\\nmuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!\"\\n\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking\\nup and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air\\ngloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her\\npower was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\\nweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\\nwonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.\\n\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\\nhumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed\\nup every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\\nElizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by\\nthe voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you have been\\nlong desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my\\nstay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything\\ncould be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\\nsuch distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may\\nseem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I\\nfear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley\\nto-day.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\\nurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\\nlong as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\\n\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for\\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\\nreason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\\none serious, parting look, went away.\\n\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as\\nhad marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full\\nof contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.\\n\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's\\nchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\\notherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on\\na first interview with its object, and even before two words have been\\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,\\nand that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other\\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him\\ngo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\\nbusiness. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained\\na hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\\nof her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\\nletter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\\nWickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\\nfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\\nas this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose\\nLydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention\\nof marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue\\nnor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\n\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\\nLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia\\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\\nofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\\nraised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been\\nfluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\\nfeel it!\\n\\nShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\\nfamily so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\\nimportance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.\\nand Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's\\naccount that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them\\ninstantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their\\nsummons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript\\nof the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a\\nfavourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply\\nafflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the\\nfirst exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every\\nassistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked\\nhim with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,\\neverything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to\\nbe off as soon as possible. \"But what is to be done about Pemberley?\"\\ncried Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\\nus; was it so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\\n_That_ is all settled.\"\\n\\n\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\\nprepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\\ntruth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\\n\\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the\\nhurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\\nto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\\nimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\\nbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\\nbe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\\nsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\\nGardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 47\\n\\n\\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle, as they\\ndrove from the town; \"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\\nmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the\\nmatter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should\\nform such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I\\nam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\\nwould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\\nregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\\nnot adequate to the risk!\"\\n\\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\\n\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle's\\nopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\\ninterest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of\\nWickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe\\nhim capable of it?\"\\n\\n\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\nneglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I\\ndare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been\\nthe case?\"\\n\\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute proof\\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such\\na presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\\nBarnet road.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though\\nfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is\\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\\nexpeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\"\\n\\n\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\\nmarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\\nfriend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending\\nto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\\ncannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she\\nbeyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,\\nforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\\nrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has\\nno brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\\ndo as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\\nsuch a matter.\"\\n\\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him\\nas to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\"\\n\\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, with\\ntears in her eyes, \"that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such\\na point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\\nPerhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never\\nbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,\\nnay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement\\nand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\\nand frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\\nSince the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\\nflirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing\\neverything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\\ngreater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are\\nnaturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\\nperson and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\n\\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so very ill of\\nWickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\n\\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\\ntheir former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,\\ntill it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\\nWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\\nsense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\\nas false and deceitful as he is insinuating.\"\\n\\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\\nas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\n\\n\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring. \"I told you, the other day,\\nof his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at\\nLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved\\nwith such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\\ncircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\\nrelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\\nwhat he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\\nreserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\\nmust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\\nher.\"\\n\\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\\nand Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\\nso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\\nignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire\\nwas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the\\ncase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\\nnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could\\nit apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the\\nneighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was\\nsettled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\\nher eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be\\nin any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\\nconsequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far\\nenough from my thoughts.\"\\n\\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\\nsuppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\\n\\n\"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\\nside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\\nthat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\\nhe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\\nwere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\\nthe first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\\nwild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\\nwho treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\"\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\\nto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by\\nits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\\nthe whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.\\nFixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find\\nno interval of ease or forgetfulness.\\n\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night\\non the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a\\ncomfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied\\nby long expectations.\\n\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\\non the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the\\ncarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\\nfaces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\\ncapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\\n\\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\\nhurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her\\nmother's apartment, immediately met her.\\n\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\\neyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\\nheard of the fugitives.\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane. \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\\neverything will be well.\"\\n\\n\"Is my father in town?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\\n\\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\n\\n\"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say\\nthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\\nparticularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write\\nagain till he had something of importance to mention.\"\\n\\n\"And my mother--how is she? How are you all?\"\\n\\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\\nshaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\\nall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\\nHeaven, are quite well.\"\\n\\n\"But you--how are you?\" cried Elizabeth. \"You look pale. How much you\\nmust have gone through!\"\\n\\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\\nconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\\nengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach\\nof the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\\nthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\\n\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\\nhad already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\\nfound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of\\ngood, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet\\ndeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\\nevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\\nto explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'\\nconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\\ntears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\\nconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\\nblaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\\nerrors of her daughter must principally be owing.\\n\\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going to Brighton,\\nwith all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia\\nhad nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\\nof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\\nside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been\\nwell looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the\\ncharge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!\\nAnd now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,\\nwherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become\\nof us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his\\ngrave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we\\nshall do.\"\\n\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\\ngeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\\nthat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\\nBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\\n\\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is right to be\\nprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\\nIt is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we\\nmay gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\\nand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\\nlost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make\\nhim come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult\\ntogether as to what is to be done.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly what I\\ncould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\\nwherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\\nmarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\\ntell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\\nafter they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\\nTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my\\nwits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such\\nspasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that\\nI can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to\\ngive any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does\\nnot know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I\\nknow you will contrive it all.\"\\n\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\\nin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well\\nin her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till\\ndinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on\\nthe housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\\n\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\\noccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\\noppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\\ntongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\\nbetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\\nmost trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\\nsubject.\\n\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\\ntoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\\nbefore. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The\\nfaces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible\\nin either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\\nwhich she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of\\nfretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance\\nof grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:\\n\\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\\nBut we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\\neach other the balm of sisterly consolation.\"\\n\\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\\n\"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\\nlesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one\\nfalse step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less\\nbrittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in\\nher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\"\\n\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed\\nto make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\\nkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\nhalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of\\nthe opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to\\nsatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\\nof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\\nBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\\nthe subject, by saying, \"But tell me all and everything about it which\\nI have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\\nForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\\ntook place? They must have seen them together for ever.\"\\n\\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\\nespecially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\\ngrieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\\n_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\\nfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\\n\\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\\ntheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\\ntheir plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\\nrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am\\ninclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\"\\n\\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\n\\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt\\na little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him\\nin marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\\nright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\\nimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter\\nshe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\\nbeing in love with each other, many weeks.\"\\n\\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\n\\n\"No, I believe not.\"\\n\\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does\\nhe know his real character?\"\\n\\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\\ndid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad\\naffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;\\nbut I hope this may be false.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\\nthis could not have happened!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister. \"But to expose\\nthe former faults of any person without knowing what their present\\nfeelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.\"\\n\\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his\\nwife?\"\\n\\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\\n\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These\\nwere the contents:\\n\\n\"MY DEAR HARRIET,\\n\\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\\nlaughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am\\nmissed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,\\nI shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I\\nlove, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think\\nit no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my\\ngoing, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,\\nwhen I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good joke\\nit will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to\\nPratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.\\nTell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will\\ndance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall\\nsend for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell\\nSally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are\\npacked up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will\\ndrink to our good journey.\\n\\n\"Your affectionate friend,\\n\\n\"LYDIA BENNET.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she had\\nfinished it. \"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!\\nBut at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their\\njourney. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her\\nside a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\\n\\n\"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten\\nminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in\\nsuch confusion!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it who\\ndid not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is\\nvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to\\ngive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so\\nmuch as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen\\nalmost took from me my faculties.\"\\n\\n\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look\\nwell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety\\nupon yourself alone.\"\\n\\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every\\nfatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.\\nKitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours\\nof repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn\\non Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\\nThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And\\nLady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if\\nthey should be of use to us.\"\\n\\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth; \"perhaps she\\n_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see\\ntoo little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence\\ninsufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.\"\\n\\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had\\nintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\\n\\n\"He meant I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place where\\nthey last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could\\nbe made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the\\nnumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come\\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a\\ngentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might\\nbe remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow\\ndiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\\ndetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible\\nto find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any\\nother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,\\nand his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\\nout even so much as this.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 48\\n\\n\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next\\nmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.\\nHis family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and\\ndilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.\\nThey were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to\\nsend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.\\nGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\\n\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant\\ninformation of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,\\nto prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,\\nto the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only\\nsecurity for her husband's not being killed in a duel.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few\\ndays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable\\nto her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a\\ngreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also\\nvisited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of\\ncheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without\\nreporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,\\nshe seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\\nthem.\\n\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months\\nbefore, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt\\nto every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with\\nthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.\\nEverybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;\\nand everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the\\nappearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\\nhalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of\\nher sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less\\nof it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come\\nwhen, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely\\ndespaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of\\nthem.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a\\nletter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately\\nfound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;\\nthat Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,\\nbut without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now\\ndetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first\\ncoming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself\\ndid not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was\\neager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.\\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised\\nto write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:\\n\\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\npossible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,\\nwhether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to\\nknow in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were\\nanyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a\\nclue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have\\nnothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in\\nhis power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any\\nother person.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her\\nauthority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information\\nof so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never\\nheard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both\\nof whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of\\nhis companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;\\nand though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application\\nwas a something to look forward to.\\n\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\\npart of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters\\nwas the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,\\nwhatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every\\nsucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\\n\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for\\ntheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane\\nhad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\\nshe accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\\nletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as\\nfollows:\\n\\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\\n\\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\\nin life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\\nsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from\\nHertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself\\nsincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in\\nyour present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because\\nproceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be\\nwanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that\\nmay comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the\\nmost afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would\\nhave been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to\\nbe lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte\\ninforms me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has\\nproceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,\\nfor the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think\\nthat her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be\\nguilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,\\nyou are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined\\nby Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to\\nwhom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that\\nthis false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of\\nall the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,\\nwill connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads\\nme moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event\\nof last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\\nin all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to\\nconsole yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child\\nfrom your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her\\nown heinous offense.\\n\\n\"I am, dear sir, etc., etc.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from\\nColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\\nIt was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he\\nkept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one\\nliving. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he\\nhad been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of\\nparticular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,\\nwho could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the\\nwretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for\\nsecrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for\\nit had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a\\nvery considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a\\nthousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.\\nHe owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\\nformidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars\\nfrom the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. \"A gamester!\"\\nshe cried. \"This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\"\\n\\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their\\nfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered\\nspiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded\\nto his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and\\nleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\\nfor continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did\\nnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\\nwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.\\n\\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\" she cried. \"Sure he\\nwill not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,\\nand make him marry her, if he comes away?\"\\n\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she\\nand the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet\\ncame from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their\\njourney, and brought its master back to Longbourn.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her\\nDerbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His\\nname had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and\\nthe kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their\\nbeing followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had\\nreceived none since her return that could come from Pemberley.\\n\\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for\\nthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be\\nfairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time\\ntolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware\\nthat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\\nLydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,\\none sleepless night out of two.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\nphilosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the\\nhabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\\naway, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of\\nit.\\n\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that\\nElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly\\nexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, \"Say\\nnothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,\\nand I ought to feel it.\"\\n\\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone\\nto fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have\\nbeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\\nIt will pass away soon enough.\"\\n\\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\\n\\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\\n\\n\"She is happy then,\" said her father drily; \"and her residence there\\nwill probably be of some duration.\"\\n\\nThen after a short silence he continued:\\n\\n\"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me\\nlast May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.\"\\n\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's\\ntea.\\n\\n\"This is a parade,\" he cried, \"which does one good; it gives such an\\nelegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my\\nlibrary, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as\\nI can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.\"\\n\\n\"I am not going to run away, papa,\" said Kitty fretfully. \"If I should\\never go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\"\\n\\n\"_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne\\nfor fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and\\nyou will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into\\nmy house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be\\nabsolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.\\nAnd you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have\\nspent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.\"\\n\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\n\\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good\\ngirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 49\\n\\n\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking\\ntogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper\\ncoming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their\\nmother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,\\nwhen they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon,\\nmadam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.\"\\n\\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \"don't you know\\nthere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here\\nthis half-hour, and master has had a letter.\"\\n\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They\\nran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the\\nlibrary; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of\\nseeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the\\nbutler, who said:\\n\\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the\\nlittle copse.\"\\n\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once\\nmore, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately\\npursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\\n\\nJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as\\nElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,\\ncame up with him, and eagerly cried out:\\n\\n\"Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?\"\\n\\n\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?\"\\n\\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the letter from\\nhis pocket. \"But perhaps you would like to read it.\"\\n\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\\n\\n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know myself what it is\\nabout.\"\\n\\n\"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.\\n\\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,\\n\\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,\\nupon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you\\nleft me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of\\nLondon they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough\\nto know they are discovered. I have seen them both--\"\\n\\n\"Then it is as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are married!\"\\n\\nElizabeth read on:\\n\\n\"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there\\nwas any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the\\nengagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will\\nnot be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure\\nto your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand\\npounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and\\nmy sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,\\nduring your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\\nwhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,\\nas far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by\\nexpress, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You\\nwill easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's\\ncircumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.\\nThe world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there\\nwill be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to\\nsettle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude\\nwill be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout\\nthe whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to\\nHaggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the\\nsmallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at\\nLongbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as\\nfast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it\\nbest that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope\\nyou will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as\\nanything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,\\n\\n\"EDW. GARDINER.\"\\n\\n\"Is it possible?\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \"Can it be\\npossible that he will marry her?\"\\n\\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\" said her\\nsister. \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\\n\\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" cried Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\\n\\nMost earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he\\nwrote.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back and write immediately.\\nConsider how important every moment is in such a case.\"\\n\\n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the trouble\\nyourself.\"\\n\\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\\n\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\\n\\n\"And may I ask--\" said Elizabeth; \"but the terms, I suppose, must be\\ncomplied with.\"\\n\\n\"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\\n\\n\"And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there\\nare two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money\\nyour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever\\nto pay him.\"\\n\\n\"Money! My uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, sir?\"\\n\\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a\\ntemptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am\\ngone.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred to me\\nbefore. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!\\nit must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has\\ndistressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said her father; \"Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing\\nless than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,\\nin the very beginning of our relationship.\"\\n\\n\"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\\nrepaid?\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued\\nsilent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the\\nlibrary to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\\n\\n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they\\nwere by themselves. \"How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be\\nthankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,\\nand wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\"\\n\\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly would\\nnot marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind\\nuncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\\nthousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children\\nof his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand\\npounds?\"\\n\\n\"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,\" said\\nElizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\\nexactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\\nnot sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never\\nbe requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\\nprotection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\\nyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\\nactually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\\nshe will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\\nfirst sees my aunt!\"\\n\\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\" said\\nJane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to\\nmarry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\\nthinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\\nthey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\\ntime make their past imprudence forgotten.\"\\n\\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as neither you, nor\\nI, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.\"\\n\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\\nperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\\ntherefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make\\nit known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly\\nreplied:\\n\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\n\\n\"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?\"\\n\\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\\n\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs\\ntogether. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication\\nwould, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,\\nthe letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As\\nsoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon\\nmarried, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\\nexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she\\nhad ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\\nwould be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\\nfelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\\n\\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried. \"This is delightful indeed! She will\\nbe married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!\\nMy good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage\\neverything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\\nclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\\nthem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him\\nhow much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\\nKitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\\nLydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\\n\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\\nthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\\nGardiner's behaviour laid them all under.\\n\\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a great\\nmeasure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to\\nassist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it but\\nher own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\\nmust have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have\\never had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!\\nIn a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\\nit sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\\nsuch a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and\\nyou write for me. We will settle with your father about the money\\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\n\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\\ncambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\\nnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her\\nfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed,\\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\\nso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.\\n\\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\\ngood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call\\non Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.\\nAn airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do\\nanything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you\\nheard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\\nall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\"\\n\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\\n\\nPoor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was\\nno worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in\\nlooking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could\\nbe justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had\\nfeared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had\\ngained.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 50\\n\\n\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,\\ninstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for\\nthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\\nhim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever\\nof honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be\\nher husband might then have rested in its proper place.\\n\\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\\nshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he\\nwas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\\nand to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\\n\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\\nuseless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join\\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\\nand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\\nBennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he\\nwould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then\\ntoo late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\\nhusband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\\nincome.\\n\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\\nthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\\nlatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\\nregard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,\\nthough expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\\nengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would\\nbe done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\\narrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the\\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\\nallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\\nthrough her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within\\nthat sum.\\n\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\\nanother very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as\\nlittle trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\\nof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\\nnaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\\ndispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick\\nin its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he\\nwas indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any\\nmessage to her.\\n\\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate\\nspeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\\nphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage\\nof conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\\nhappiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant\\nfarmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from\\nall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit\\nin this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery\\nwas considered certain.\\n\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this\\nhappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\\nspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\\ntriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object\\nof her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\\nattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\\nservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\\nproper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering\\nwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\\nimportance.\\n\\n\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could quit it--or the\\ngreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\\ntoo far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\\nPulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\\n\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\\nservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: \"Mrs.\\nBennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and\\ndaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\\nneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\\nimpudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\"\\n\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It\\nsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\\nthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\\ndaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\\naffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\\nit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her\\nmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe\\npossible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new\\nclothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of\\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\\ntook place.\\n\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\\nthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\\nher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the\\nproper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\\nunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\\nspot.\\n\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were\\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\\nbut, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's\\nfrailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear\\nof disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,\\nthere seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been\\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\\nMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other\\nobjection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the\\nnearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.\\n\\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The\\nwish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\\nblow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\\nhardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\\nlonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\\nshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\\nshould meet.\\n\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\\nproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now\\nhave been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\\ndoubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,\\nthere must be a triumph.\\n\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\\ntemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\\nwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease\\nand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\\nand from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she\\nmust have received benefit of greater importance.\\n\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\\nconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\\nprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\\nfamily.\\n\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,\\nshe could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could\\nbelong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions\\nwere stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's\\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to\\npromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\\npurport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved\\non quitting the militia.\\n\\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added, \"as soon as\\nhis marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in\\nconsidering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on\\nhis account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into\\nthe regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who\\nare able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an\\nensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It\\nis an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\\nhave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have\\nwritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\\nand to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\\nin and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I\\nhave pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\\nsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\\na list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\\nhope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,\\nand all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\\nunless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\\nGardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\\nleaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\\nyou and her mother.--Yours, etc.,\\n\\n\"E. GARDINER.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal\\nfrom the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet\\nwas not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North,\\njust when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,\\nfor she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a\\npity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\\nwith everybody, and had so many favourites.\\n\\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\" said she, \"it will be quite shocking\\nto send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she\\nlikes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s\\nregiment.\"\\n\\nHis daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being\\nadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\\nreceived at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,\\nwho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and\\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\\nurged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\\nand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\\nprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their\\nmother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show\\nher married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the\\nNorth. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent\\nhis permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as\\nthe ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was\\nsurprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and\\nhad she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would\\nhave been the last object of her wishes.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 51\\n\\n\\nTheir sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\\nprobably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to\\nmeet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their\\narrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,\\nwho gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she\\nbeen the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\\nmust endure.\\n\\nThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive\\nthem. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to\\nthe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\\nanxious, uneasy.\\n\\nLydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\\nshe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\\nwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,\\nto Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an\\nalacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.\\n\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\\nso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\\nopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\\nenough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet\\nwas shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,\\nand fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their\\ncongratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly\\nround the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and\\nobserved, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been\\nthere.\\n\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners\\nwere always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been\\nexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\\nclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had\\nnot before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,\\nresolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence\\nof an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the\\ntwo who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.\\n\\nThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\\nof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\\nElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\\nwith a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her\\nreplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\\nworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\\nvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\\nthe world.\\n\\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I went away;\\nit seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things\\nenough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\\nI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\\nthought it would be very good fun if I was.\"\\n\\nHer father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked\\nexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of\\nwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \"Oh! mamma, do the\\npeople hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;\\nand we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he\\nshould know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took\\noff my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that\\nhe might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;\\nand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\\nthe dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\\nanxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say\\nto her eldest sister, \"Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go\\nlower, because I am a married woman.\"\\n\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment\\nfrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\\nspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and\\nall their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\"\\nby each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her\\nring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\n\\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast\\nroom, \"and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I\\nam sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half\\nmy good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get\\nhusbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\n\\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't\\nat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\\nthings. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We\\nshall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some\\nballs, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\"\\n\\n\"I should like it beyond anything!\" said her mother.\\n\\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\\nbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\\nwinter is over.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth; \"but I do not\\nparticularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\\n\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\\nhad received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\\nhis regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\n\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\\nshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\\nhaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\\nall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\\nthink, than such as did not.\\n\\nWickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected\\nto find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her\\npresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather\\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\\nfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\\nthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\\nof having a companion.\\n\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\\noccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every\\nthing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on\\nthe first of September, than any body else in the country.\\n\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\\nelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:\\n\\n\"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You\\nwere not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you\\ncurious to hear how it was managed?\"\\n\\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too little said\\non the subject.\"\\n\\n\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\\nmarried, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in\\nthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\\no'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\\nwere to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in\\nsuch a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to\\nput it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was\\nmy aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as\\nif she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in\\nten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed\\nto know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe\\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\\nfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was\\nrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so\\njust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon\\nbusiness to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once\\nthey get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I\\ndid not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we\\nwere beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he\\ncame back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,\\nI recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the\\nwedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious\\nme! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\\nthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\"\\n\\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on the\\nsubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \"we will\\nask you no questions.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly tell you\\nall, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\n\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\\npower, by running away.\\n\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least\\nit was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at\\nher sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\\nwhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\\nConjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\\nbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\\nplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\\ncould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\\nwrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\\nintended.\\n\\n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity must be\\nto know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively\\nspeaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\\na time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\\nfor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems\\nto think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\\nignorance.\"\\n\\n\"Not that I _shall_, though,\" she added to herself, as she finished\\nthe letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable\\nmanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it\\nout.\"\\n\\nJane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad\\nof it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\\nsatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 52\\n\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as\\nsoon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it\\nthan, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to\\nbe interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to\\nbe happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\\ncontain a denial.\\n\\n\"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.\\n\\n\"MY DEAR NIECE,\\n\\n\"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning\\nto answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise\\nwhat I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your\\napplication; I did not expect it from _you_. Don't think me angry,\\nhowever, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such\\ninquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to\\nunderstand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised\\nas I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned\\nwould have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really\\ninnocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.\\n\\n\"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most\\nunexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several\\nhours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so\\ndreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.\\nGardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,\\nand that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,\\nLydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\\nafter ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\\nthem. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\\nhimself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to\\nmake it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide\\nin him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and\\nconfessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private\\nactions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He\\ncalled it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy\\nan evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_\\nmotive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days\\nin town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to\\ndirect his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness\\nof this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.\\n\\n\"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\\ngoverness to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause\\nof disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large\\nhouse in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\\nlodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with\\nWickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to\\ntown. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\\nwanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and\\ncorruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.\\nWickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had\\nshe been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up\\ntheir abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the\\nwished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and\\nafterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he\\nacknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful\\nsituation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed\\non to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But\\nhe found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared\\nfor none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear\\nof leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\\nother, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,\\nit only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,\\nin his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never\\nbeen _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,\\non account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and\\nscrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her\\nown folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as\\nto his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He\\nmust go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\\nnothing to live on.\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though\\nMr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able\\nto do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by\\nmarriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still\\ncherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in\\nsome other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely\\nto be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\\n\\n\"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of\\ncourse wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be\\nreasonable.\\n\\n\"Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to\\nmake your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\\nstreet the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be\\nseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was\\nstill with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge\\nyour father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your\\nuncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the\\ndeparture of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next\\nday it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.\\n\\n\"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,\\nand, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.\\n\\n\"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all\\nsettled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\\nLongbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that\\nobstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been\\naccused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.\\nNothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and\\nI do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your\\nuncle would most readily have settled the whole.\\n\\n\"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either\\nthe gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle\\nwas forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his\\nniece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\\nwhich went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter\\nthis morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation\\nthat would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\\nit was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane\\nat most.\\n\\n\"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young\\npeople. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably\\nmore than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own\\nsettled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all\\nthis was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It\\nwas owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\\nWickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he\\nhad been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth\\nin _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,\\ncan be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,\\nmy dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would\\nnever have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another\\ninterest_ in the affair.\\n\\n\"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who\\nwere still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in\\nLondon once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were\\nthen to receive the last finish.\\n\\n\"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which\\nyou tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not\\nafford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant\\nadmission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I\\nknew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\\nsatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not\\nperceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming\\nhome was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell\\nyou can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most\\nserious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had\\ndone, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she\\nheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was\\nsometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and\\nJane, and for their sakes had patience with her.\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,\\nattended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave\\ntown again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my\\ndear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\\nenough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,\\nin every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His\\nunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little\\nmore liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach\\nhim. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But\\nslyness seems the fashion.\\n\\n\"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\\npunish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy\\ntill I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little\\npair of ponies, would be the very thing.\\n\\n\"But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half\\nhour.\\n\\n\"Yours, very sincerely,\\n\\n\"M. GARDINER.\"\\n\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\\nin which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\\ngreatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\\nproduced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's\\nmatch, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too\\ngreat to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the\\npain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!\\nHe had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all\\nthe trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which\\nsupplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and\\ndespise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason\\nwith, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to\\navoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had\\ndone all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her\\nheart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly\\nchecked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity\\nwas insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for\\na woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so\\nnatural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law\\nof Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,\\nto be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had\\ngiven a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary\\nstretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been\\nwrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and\\nthough she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she\\ncould, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist\\nhis endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially\\nconcerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were\\nunder obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They\\nowed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!\\nhow heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever\\nencouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For\\nherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause\\nof compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.\\nShe read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It\\nwas hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some\\npleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she\\nand her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted\\nbetween Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n\\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's\\napproach; and before she could strike into another path, she was\\novertaken by Wickham.\\n\\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\" said he,\\nas he joined her.\\n\\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does not follow\\nthat the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\n\\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and\\nnow we are better.\"\\n\\n\"True. Are the others coming out?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\\nMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\n\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\n\\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\\nold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\\nme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she did.\"\\n\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\n\\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\\nout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\\nmisrepresented.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said:\\n\\n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\\nseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said\\nElizabeth. \"It must be something particular, to take him there at this\\ntime of year.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\\nunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\n\\n\"And do you like her?\"\\n\\n\"Very much.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\\nor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\\nyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\n\\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\n\\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\n\\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A\\nmost delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited\\nme in every respect.\"\\n\\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\n\\n\"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,\\nand the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to\\nrepine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The\\nquiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas\\nof happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\\ncircumstance, when you were in Kent?\"\\n\\n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\"\\n\\n\"You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\\nfirst, you may remember.\"\\n\\n\"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not\\nso palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\\nhad been compromised accordingly.\"\\n\\n\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\\nwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\"\\n\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast\\nto get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him,\\nshe only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:\\n\\n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let\\nus quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\\nmind.\"\\n\\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though\\nhe hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 53\\n\\n\\nMr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he\\nnever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\\nby introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\\nhad said enough to keep him quiet.\\n\\nThe day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was\\nforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\\nentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\\ncontinue at least a twelvemonth.\\n\\n\"Oh! my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\\nwriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\\ndo.\"\\n\\nMr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He\\nsmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\\n\\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\\nthe house, \"as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to\\nus all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\\nhimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\"\\n\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\\n\\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as parting with\\none's friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\"\\n\\n\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\" said\\nElizabeth. \"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\\nsingle.\"\\n\\n\"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,\\nbut only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If\\nthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\"\\n\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\\nrelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an\\narticle of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\\nat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\\nmaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\\nweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\\nsmiled and shook her head by turns.\\n\\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\" (for Mrs.\\nPhillips first brought her the news). \"Well, so much the better. Not\\nthat I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am\\nsure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome\\nto come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?\\nBut that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to\\nmention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\"\\n\\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls was in\\nMeryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\\nto know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He\\ncomes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\\ngoing to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\\nWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\\ncolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:\\n\\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from\\nany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\\nI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\\nme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\\nalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\\n_myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.\"\\n\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\\nDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\\nother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\\nto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\\nthere _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come\\nwithout it.\\n\\n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man cannot\\ncome to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this\\nspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.\"\\n\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\\nfeelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\\nperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\\nmore unequal, than she had often seen them.\\n\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\\nabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\\n\\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"you\\nwill wait on him of course.\"\\n\\n\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.\"\\n\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\\nwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\\nNetherfield.\\n\\n\"'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he. \"If he wants our society,\\nlet him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours\\nin running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\\nagain.\"\\n\\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\\non him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I\\nam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\\nmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\\nhim.\"\\n\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\\nhusband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\\nneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\\n_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\\n\\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her sister. \"It\\nwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can\\nhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\\nbut she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\\nsays. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\\n\\n\"I wish I could say anything to comfort you,\" replied Elizabeth; \"but it\\nis wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\\nof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\\nalways so much.\"\\n\\nMr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\\ncontrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\\nand fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted\\nthe days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;\\nhopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his\\narrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\\nenter the paddock and ride towards the house.\\n\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\\nkept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\\nto the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\\nagain by her sister.\\n\\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it be?\"\\n\\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\\nknow.\"\\n\\n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to be with\\nhim before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man.\"\\n\\n\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\\nMr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\\nsay that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\n\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\\nof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\\nwhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\\nafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\\nenough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\\nmother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\\ncivil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either\\nof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\\nGardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\\nTo Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\\nand whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as\\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\\nbehaviour in Derbyshire.\\n\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a\\nminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\\nher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\\nwishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\\n\\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be early\\nenough for expectation.\"\\n\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\\nlift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of\\nher sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\\npaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\\ngentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\\nsymptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\n\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\\nhad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,\\nshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\\nshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's\\npresence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but\\nnot an improbable, conjecture.\\n\\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\\nsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\\nBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\\nher curtsey and address to his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter\\nthe preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,\\nwas hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\\napplied.\\n\\nDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question\\nwhich she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He\\nwas not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\\nit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,\\nwhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without\\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\\nthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\\nfound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\\nthe ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\\nthey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\\nwith herself for being so.\\n\\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did he come?\"\\n\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.\\n\\nShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\n\\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\n\\n\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say\\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,\\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my\\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\\nseen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;\\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,\\nGeorge Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a\\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\\nIt was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\\nmake such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\\n\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\\ndared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\\nnot tell.\\n\\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\"\\ncontinued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\\nhard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to\\nNewcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay\\nI do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have\\nheard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\\nregulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so\\nmany as he deserves.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such\\nmisery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,\\nhowever, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\\ndone before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in\\nthe country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\\n\\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\" said her mother,\\n\"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\\nBennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\\nwill save all the best of the covies for you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\\nattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had\\nflattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be\\nhastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt\\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\\nmoments of such painful confusion.\\n\\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never more to\\nbe in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\\none or the other again!\"\\n\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\\nhow much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her\\nformer lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\\nbut every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He\\nfound her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and\\nas unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\\nthat she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,\\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\\nintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\\nLongbourn in a few days time.\\n\\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added, \"for when\\nyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\\nus, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure\\nyou, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep\\nyour engagement.\"\\n\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\\nhis concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\\nthere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\\nnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man\\non whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\\nof one who had ten thousand a year.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 54\\n\\n\\nAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\\nor in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that\\nmust deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.\\n\\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\" said she,\\n\"did he come at all?\"\\n\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\n\\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when\\nhe was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If\\nhe no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will\\nthink no more about him.\"\\n\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\\nof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her\\nbetter satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\\neasy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\\nhis coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\\nseen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent\\nacquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly. \"Oh, Jane,\\ntake care.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?\"\\n\\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\\nyou as ever.\"\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good\\nhumour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had\\nrevived.\\n\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality\\nas sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\\nthe place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\\nher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore\\nto invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\\ndecided. He placed himself by her.\\n\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.\\nHe bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that\\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\\nlikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\\nalarm.\\n\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an\\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\\nElizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his\\nown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\\nno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\\ncould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\\nadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but\\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\\ncold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,\\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;\\nand she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\\nhim that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the\\nfamily.\\n\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\\nbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than\\nthe mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious\\nand uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the\\ngentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her\\nuncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\n\\n\"If he does not come to me, _then_,\" said she, \"I shall give him up for\\never.\"\\n\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\\nanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\\nwhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\\nin so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her\\nwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of\\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:\\n\\n\"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\\ndo we?\"\\n\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\\nher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\\nto help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for\\nbeing so silly!\\n\\n\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not\\nprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\"\\n\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup\\nhimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:\\n\\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\n\\n\"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,\\nthese three weeks.\"\\n\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\\nwith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering\\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\n\\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies\\nall rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,\\nwhen all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her\\nmother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\\nwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had\\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\\nof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\\nsupper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the\\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\n\\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \"What\\nsay you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,\\nI assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\\nvenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so\\nfat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\\nLucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\\ncooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\\nbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\\nwhat do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\\nat Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good\\na creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,\\nand not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of\\nBingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at\\nlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\\nhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\\nnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\\n\\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \"The\\nparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\\nmay often meet again.\"\\n\\nElizabeth smiled.\\n\\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.\\nI assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\\nagreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am\\nperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\\nany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed\\nwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\\npleasing, than any other man.\"\\n\\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me smile, and\\nare provoking me to it every moment.\"\\n\\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\\n\\n\"And how impossible in others!\"\\n\\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\nacknowledge?\"\\n\\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to\\ninstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive\\nme; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 55\\n\\n\\nA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His\\nfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\\nten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\\ngood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\\nexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\n\\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more lucky.\"\\n\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would\\ngive him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.\\n\\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\n\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\\naccepted with alacrity.\\n\\nHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them\\ndressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing\\ngown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:\\n\\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\\ncome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\\nBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\\nLizzy's hair.\"\\n\\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say Kitty is\\nforwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!\\nWhere is your sash, my dear?\"\\n\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\\nwithout one of her sisters.\\n\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\\nevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\\ncustom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of\\nthe five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\\nElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\\nKitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma? What do\\nyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\" She then sat still\\nfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \"Come here, my love, I want to\\nspeak to you,\" took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look\\nat Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her\\nentreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.\\nBennet half-opened the door and called out:\\n\\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\n\\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her mother, as\\nsoon as she was in the hall. \"Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in\\nmy dressing-room.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\\nquietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\\ninto the drawing-room.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every\\nthing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His\\nease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their\\nevening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the\\nmother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command\\nof countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.\\n\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went\\naway, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.\\nBennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\\n\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\\nbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in\\nthe happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\\nreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\\npersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's\\nconcurrence.\\n\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent\\nthe morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\\nagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\\nor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\\nsilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\\nother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\\nand in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get\\nevery body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\\nto write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\\nfor as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\\nwanted to counteract her mother's schemes.\\n\\nBut on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she\\nsaw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\\nhad been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her\\nsister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\\nearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\\nboth, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would\\nhave told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she\\nthought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\\nElizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as\\nwell as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\\nwords to her sister, ran out of the room.\\n\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\\npleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\\nemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\\n\\n\"'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!\\nwhy is not everybody as happy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,\\na delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\\nkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\\nsaid for the present.\\n\\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not on any\\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\\nfrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to\\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\\nfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness!\"\\n\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\\ncard party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\n\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\\nwith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\\nprevious months of suspense and vexation.\\n\\n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend's anxious\\ncircumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the\\nhappiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\\n\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\\nfather had been short and to the purpose.\\n\\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\n\\n\"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.\"\\n\\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\\nand affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed\\nher delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\\ngreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\\nto all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;\\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\\nexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\\nbasis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of\\nJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\\nhimself.\\n\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\\nMiss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as\\nmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\\nher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or\\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when\\nMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\\nhow really happy he was.\\n\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\\nturned to his daughter, and said:\\n\\n\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\"\\n\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\ngoodness.\\n\\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure in\\nthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\\ndoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\\neach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\\nalways exceed your income.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\\nunpardonable in me.\"\\n\\n\"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife, \"what are you\\ntalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\\nmore.\" Then addressing her daughter, \"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so\\nhappy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\\nwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\\nbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\\nhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\\nthat you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\\never was seen!\"\\n\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\\nfavourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger\\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.\\n\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\n\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\\ncoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\\nsupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\\ndetested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself\\nobliged to accept.\\n\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\\nwhile he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;\\nbut she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours\\nof separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he\\nalways attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of\\nher; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of\\nrelief.\\n\\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling me that he\\nwas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\\nit possible.\"\\n\\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he account for\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to\\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\\ncan never be what we once were to each other.\"\\n\\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that I ever\\nheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\\nthe dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.\"\\n\\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\\nhe really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being\\nindifferent would have prevented his coming down again!\"\\n\\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\\nmodesty.\"\\n\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\\nthe little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased\\nto find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,\\nthough Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she\\nknew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\n\\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\" cried\\nJane. \"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\\nabove them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but\\nsuch another man for you!\"\\n\\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as\\nyou. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\\nhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\"\\n\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\\nsecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,\\nand she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\\nneighbours in Meryton.\\n\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\\nworld, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 56\\n\\n\\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been\\nformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\\ndining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the\\nsound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up\\nthe lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\\nwere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\\npreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\\nsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\\nthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\\nshrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\\nopen and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\\n\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\\ninferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\n\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\\nother reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the\\nhead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\\nname to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of\\nintroduction had been made.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\\nhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\\nfor a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\\nmother.\"\\n\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\n\\n\"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.\\n\"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\\nand my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man\\nwho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.\"\\n\\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine after a short\\nsilence.\\n\\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I\\nassure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.\"\\n\\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\\nsummer; the windows are full west.\"\\n\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then\\nadded:\\n\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and\\nMrs. Collins well.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\"\\n\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\\nletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\\nrefreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\\ndeclined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\\non one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\\nwill favour me with your company.\"\\n\\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and show her ladyship about the\\ndifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\"\\n\\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\\nattended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the\\nhall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent\\nlooking rooms, walked on.\\n\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\nwaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\\nthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\\nconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\\ndisagreeable.\\n\\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she looked in\\nher face.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\\nmanner:--\\n\\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\\njourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\\ncome.\"\\n\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\n\\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account\\nfor the honour of seeing you here.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you ought to\\nknow, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\\nchoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\\ncelebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such\\nmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\\nalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your\\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\\nyou, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon\\nafterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\\n_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved\\non setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth, colouring\\nwith astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the trouble of coming\\nso far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\"\\n\\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\"\\n\\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said Elizabeth\\ncoolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report\\nis in existence.\"\\n\\n\"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\\nindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\\nreport is spread abroad?\"\\n\\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\\n\\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\"\\n\\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may\\nask questions which I shall not choose to answer.\"\\n\\n\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\\nhe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\"\\n\\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\n\\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\\nreason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\\nmay have drawn him in.\"\\n\\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\\nlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\"\\n\\n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,\\never induce me to be explicit.\"\\n\\n\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\\npresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\\nengaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?\"\\n\\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\\nmake an offer to me.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\\n\\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\\nthey have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\\n_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned\\nthe union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\\nbe accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\\ninferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\\nthe family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his\\ntacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\\npropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest\\nhours he was destined for his cousin?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is\\nno other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not\\nbe kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to\\nmarry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\\nmarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither\\nby honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\\nanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\n\\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,\\nMiss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\\nfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\\nbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\\nYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\\nby any of us.\"\\n\\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But the wife of Mr.\\nDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\\nattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\\nto repine.\"\\n\\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\\nfor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\\nscore? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\\nhere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will\\nI be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's\\nwhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\n\\n\"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;\\nbut it will have no effect on me.\"\\n\\n\"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\\nnephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\\nside, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,\\nhonourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on\\nboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\\nevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?\\nThe upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,\\nor fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you\\nwere sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in\\nwhich you have been brought up.\"\\n\\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\\nsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are\\nequal.\"\\n\\n\"True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother?\\nWho are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\\ncondition.\"\\n\\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your nephew does\\nnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\n\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\\nCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\\nmoment's deliberation:\\n\\n\"I am not.\"\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\n\\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\"\\n\\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\\nreasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that\\nI will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\\nassurance I require.\"\\n\\n\"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\\nanything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\\nyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their\\nmarriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would\\nmy refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\\nAllow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have\\nsupported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the\\napplication was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if\\nyou think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your\\nnephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;\\nbut you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,\\ntherefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\\nobjections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am\\nno stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous\\nelopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a\\npatched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is\\nsuch a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his\\nlate father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are\\nyou thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\n\\n\"You can now have nothing further to say,\" she resentfully answered.\\n\"You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to\\nthe house.\"\\n\\nAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\\nback. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\n\\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\\nUnfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you\\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.\"\\n\\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\n\\n\"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\\nwhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\\nreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\"\\n\\n\"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\\nclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\\nthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\"\\n\\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth, \"have any\\npossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either\\nwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\\nresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\\n_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's\\nconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\\nthe scorn.\"\\n\\n\"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.\\nI shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\\nambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\\nreasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.\"\\n\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of\\nthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, \"I take no leave\\nof you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve\\nno such attention. I am most seriously displeased.\"\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\\nladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She\\nheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother\\nimpatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady\\nCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.\\n\\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\n\\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\\ncivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were\\nwell. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through\\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\\nnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\"\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to\\nacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 57\\n\\n\\nThe discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\\nElizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many\\nhours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\\nappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,\\nfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\\nDarcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report\\nof their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\\ntill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\\nand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\\nexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\\nthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\\nsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours\\nat Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the\\nCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had\\nonly set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked\\nforward to as possible at some future time.\\n\\nIn revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help\\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\\nin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\\nprevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate\\nan application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar\\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\\nnot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\\nwas certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,\\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\\naddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\\nprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\\nand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\n\\nIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often\\nseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\\nunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\\nCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\\nBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\\n\\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his\\nfriend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall know how to understand\\nit. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\\nconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\\nhave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\\nat all.\"\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\\nbeen, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same\\nkind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and\\nElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\\n\\nThe next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her\\nfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my room.\"\\n\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to\\ntell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\\nconnected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it\\nmight be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the\\nconsequent explanations.\\n\\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He\\nthen said,\\n\\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\nexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\\ncontents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink\\nof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.\"\\n\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous\\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\\nand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\\nhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\\nherself; when her father continued:\\n\\n\"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\\nas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the\\nname of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\"\\n\\n\"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?\"\\n\\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with\\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\\nwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping\\nLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says\\non that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus\\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;\\nof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\\nElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\\nher elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may\\nbe reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in\\nthis land.'\\n\\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? 'This young\\ngentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of\\nmortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive\\npatronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin\\nElizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate\\nclosure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be\\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.'\\n\\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:\\n\\n\"'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine\\nthat his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with\\na friendly eye.'\\n\\n\"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\\nsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within\\nthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie\\nmore effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his\\nlife! It is admirable!\"\\n\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force\\none most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\\nlittle agreeable to her.\\n\\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes. Pray read on.\"\\n\\n\"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last\\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some\\nfamily objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\\nconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty\\nto give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and\\nher noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr.\\nCollins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad\\nbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\\nliving together before the marriage took place should be so generally\\nknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\\nfrom declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young\\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\\nvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,\\nas a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\\nnames to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion of Christian\\nforgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's\\nsituation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you\\nlook as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,\\nI hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we\\nlive, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our\\nturn?\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted. But it is so\\nstrange!\"\\n\\n\"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\\nit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_\\npointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\\nwriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any\\nconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\\nabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\"\\n\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\\nbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by\\nhis repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\\nfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she\\nwould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by\\nwhat he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but\\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\\nhis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 58\\n\\n\\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\\nElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\\nwith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's\\nvisit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time\\nto tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat\\nin momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\\ntheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\\nhabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five\\nset off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others\\nto outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy\\nwere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty\\nwas too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\\ndesperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\n\\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon\\nMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\\nwhen Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the\\nmoment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was\\nhigh, she immediately said:\\n\\n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving\\nrelief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I\\ncan no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my\\npoor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to\\nacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\\nof my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\\nand emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\\nmistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\\nwas so little to be trusted.\"\\n\\n\"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to\\nme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\\nnot rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\\nin the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\\nyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\\nsake of discovering them.\"\\n\\n\"If you _will_ thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself alone.\\nThat the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other\\ninducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your\\n_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought\\nonly of _you_.\"\\n\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\\nher companion added, \"You are too generous to trifle with me. If your\\nfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\\naffections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence\\nme on this subject for ever.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\\nhis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\\nvery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone\\nso material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make\\nher receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\\nhappiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\\nbeen able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the\\nexpression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;\\nbut, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of\\nfeelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\\naffection every moment more valuable.\\n\\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\\nbe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\\nsoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\\nto the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through\\nLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\\nsubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\\nevery expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension,\\npeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that\\nsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise\\nfrom her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\\nladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\n\\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\\nto hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,\\nhad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\\nacknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\n\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know enough\\nof my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\\nabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\\nyour relations.\"\\n\\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your\\naccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my\\nbehaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\\nunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\"\\n\\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\\nevening,\" said Elizabeth. \"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,\\nwill be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved\\nin civility.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\\nthen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\\nit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\\nreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a\\nmore gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can\\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,\\nI confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\"\\n\\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\\nimpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\\na way.\"\\n\\n\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\\nfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\\nway that would induce you to accept me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\\nall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\"\\n\\nDarcy mentioned his letter. \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon make you\\nthink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\\ncontents?\"\\n\\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her\\nformer prejudices had been removed.\\n\\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\\nnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part\\nespecially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the\\npower of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might\\njustly make you hate me.\"\\n\\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\\nopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\\nchanged as that implies.\"\\n\\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself perfectly\\ncalm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a\\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\n\\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\\nadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\\nof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now\\nso widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\\ncircumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some\\nof my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\\npleasure.\"\\n\\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your\\nretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\\narising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\\ninnocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude\\nwhich cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish\\nbeing all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I\\nwas taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I\\nwas given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\\nUnfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt\\nby my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all\\nthat was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught\\nme to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family\\ncircle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least\\nto think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I\\nwas, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been\\nbut for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You\\ntaught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,\\nI was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.\\nYou showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman\\nworthy of being pleased.\"\\n\\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\\nwishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\n\\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\\nyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\\nwrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?\"\\n\\n\"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take\\na proper direction.\"\\n\\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at\\nPemberley. You blamed me for coming?\"\\n\\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\n\\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\\nMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\\nconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\"\\n\\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to show you, by every civility in\\nmy power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to\\nobtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\\nsee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\\nintroduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an\\nhour after I had seen you.\"\\n\\nHe then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her\\ndisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\\nthe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\\nfollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness\\nthere had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\\ncomprehend.\\n\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\\neach, to be dwelt on farther.\\n\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\\nanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\\nit was time to be at home.\\n\\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder which\\nintroduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with\\ntheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\\nit.\\n\\n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\\n\\n\"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\"\\n\\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.\" And\\nthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much\\nthe case.\\n\\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he, \"I made a\\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I\\ntold him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\\naffairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had\\nthe slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\\nmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\\nto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\\nunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\\nfriend.\\n\\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she, \"when you told him\\nthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?\"\\n\\n\"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits\\nwhich I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.\"\\n\\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\\nprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\\nhis reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess\\none thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\\nangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\\nin any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\\nnow.\"\\n\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\\nfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\\nherself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,\\nand it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness\\nof Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he\\ncontinued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they\\nparted.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 59\\n\\n\\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a question\\nwhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,\\nand from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to\\nsay in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own\\nknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything\\nelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\\n\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The\\nacknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.\\nDarcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\\nand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy\\nthan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\\nthere were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt\\nin the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no\\none liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\\ndislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\\n\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\\nfrom Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\\n\\n\"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\\nyou shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\"\\n\\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and\\nI am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am\\nin earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are\\nengaged.\"\\n\\nJane looked at her doubtingly. \"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\\nyou dislike him.\"\\n\\n\"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\\ndid not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as\\nthese, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\\nremember it myself.\"\\n\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\\nseriously assured her of its truth.\\n\\n\"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,\" cried\\nJane. \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you\\ncertain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\\nhappy with him?\"\\n\\n\"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that\\nwe are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,\\nJane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\"\\n\\n\"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\\ndelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\\nreally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\\nmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\\nto do?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I\\ntell you all.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\\nafraid you will be angry.\"\\n\\n\"My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let\\nme know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me\\nhow long you have loved him?\"\\n\\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.\\nBut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\\nat Pemberley.\"\\n\\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\\ndesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances\\nof attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\\nfurther to wish.\\n\\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as myself.\\nI always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,\\nI must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your\\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But\\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\\ntell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\\nof it to another, not to you.\"\\n\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling\\nto mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\\nher equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer\\nconceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,\\nand half the night spent in conversation.\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next\\nmorning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with\\nour dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\\ncoming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or\\nother, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?\\nLizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's\\nway.\"\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\\nwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\\nepithet.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\\nshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\\nand he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\\nhereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\"\\n\\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"to walk\\nto Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\\nnever seen the view.\"\\n\\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but I am\\nsure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?\" Kitty owned that\\nshe had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see\\nthe view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went\\nup stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:\\n\\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\\ndisagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is\\nall for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking\\nto him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to\\ninconvenience.\"\\n\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be\\nasked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the\\napplication for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother\\nwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\\nwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she\\nwere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\\nwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit\\nto her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear\\nthe first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\\ndisapprobation.\\n\\n                          * * * * *\\n\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\\nMr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\\nextreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to\\nbe made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,\\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\\nfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched\\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\\nhe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\\npretending to admire her work said in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he\\nwants you in the library.\" She was gone directly.\\n\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be\\naccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\"\\n\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\\nreasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\\nof her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\\nBut will they make you happy?\"\\n\\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your belief of my\\nindifference?\"\\n\\n\"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\\nthis would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\n\\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I love him.\\nIndeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\\nsuch terms.\"\\n\\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent. He is the kind\\nof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\\ncondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\\nhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know\\nyour disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\\nrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked\\nup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\\ndiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\\n_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\\nabout.\"\\n\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and\\nat length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object\\nof her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of\\nhim had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection\\nwas not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months'\\nsuspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did\\nconquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\n\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no more to\\nsay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\\nyou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.\"\\n\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\\nhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\\n\\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;\\nmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him\\nhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\\nand economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have\\npaid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own\\nway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about\\nhis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\"\\n\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading\\nMr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\\nat last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, \"If any young men come\\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\"\\n\\nElizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\\nhalf an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\\nthe others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for\\ngaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\\nanything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\\nwould come in time.\\n\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\\nand made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;\\nfor on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to\\nutter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could\\ncomprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit\\nwhat was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\\nlover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\\nher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\\n\\n\"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\\nhave thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\\nand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\\nyou will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\\npleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my\\ndear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I\\nhope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing\\nthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\\nLord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\"\\n\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and\\nElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\\nsoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\\nher mother followed her.\\n\\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else! Ten\\nthousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a\\nspecial licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But\\nmy dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,\\nthat I may have it to-morrow.\"\\n\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman\\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain\\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'\\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to\\nhim, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her\\ndeference for his opinion.\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\\nacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising\\nevery hour in his esteem.\\n\\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he. \"Wickham, perhaps,\\nis my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well\\nas Jane's.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 60\\n\\n\\nElizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.\\nDarcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. \"How could\\nyou begin?\" said she. \"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when\\nyou had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first\\nplace?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which\\nlaid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I\\nknew that I _had_ begun.\"\\n\\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\\nto _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\\nto you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;\\ndid you admire me for my impertinence?\"\\n\\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\\n\\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.\\nThe fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\\nattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\\nand looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and\\ninterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really\\namiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you\\ntook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and\\nin your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\\ncourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for\\nit; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\\nreasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks\\nof _that_ when they fall in love.\"\\n\\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was\\nill at Netherfield?\"\\n\\n\"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it\\nby all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\\nto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me\\nto find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may\\nbe; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling\\nto come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first\\ncalled, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did\\nyou look as if you did not care about me?\"\\n\\n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\"\\n\\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\\n\\n\"And so was I.\"\\n\\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\\n\\n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\\n\\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\\nI should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you\\n_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when\\nyou _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of\\nthanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.\\n_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\\nsprings from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the\\nsubject. This will never do.\"\\n\\n\"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady\\nCatherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of\\nremoving all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to\\nyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour\\nto wait for any opening of yours. My aunt's intelligence had given me\\nhope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\"\\n\\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,\\nfor she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to\\nNetherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?\\nor had you intended any more serious consequence?\"\\n\\n\"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I\\nmight ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to\\nmyself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,\\nand if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.\"\\n\\n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to\\nbefall her?\"\\n\\n\"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it\\nought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be\\ndone directly.\"\\n\\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and\\nadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But\\nI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.\"\\n\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy\\nhad been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's\\nlong letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would\\nbe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and\\naunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as\\nfollows:\\n\\n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,\\nfor your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the\\ntruth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.\\nBut _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your\\nfancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the\\nsubject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you\\ncannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a\\ngreat deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,\\nfor not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your\\nidea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I\\nam the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so\\nbefore, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she\\nonly smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that\\nhe can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.\\nYours, etc.\"\\n\\nMr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still\\ndifferent from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply\\nto his last.\\n\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\n\\n\"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon\\nbe the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.\\nBut, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.\\n\\n\"Yours sincerely, etc.\"\\n\\nMiss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching\\nmarriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even\\nto Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her\\nformer professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was\\naffected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing\\nher a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.\\n\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,\\nwas as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were\\ninsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\\nbeing loved by her sister.\\n\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\\nto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the\\nCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this\\nsudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered\\nso exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that\\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\\nthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\\nsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of\\nher husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\\nmeeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did\\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\\n\\nMrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his\\nforbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in\\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good\\nhumour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.\\nNor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all\\nlikely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield\\nhim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep\\nhim to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\\nwithout mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising\\nfrom all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it\\nadded to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to\\nthe time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing\\nto either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at\\nPemberley.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 61\\n\\n\\nHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got\\nrid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride\\nshe afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may\\nbe guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the\\naccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many\\nof her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,\\namiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it\\nwas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity\\nin so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and\\ninvariably silly.\\n\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her\\ndrew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in\\ngoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\\n\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near\\na vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to\\n_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his\\nsisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\\nto Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\\nof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\n\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with\\nher two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally\\nknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a\\ntemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example,\\nshe became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\\nignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's\\nsociety she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\\nballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\\n\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\\ndrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite\\nunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\\nshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\\nlonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,\\nit was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\\nmuch reluctance.\\n\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from\\nthe marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that\\nElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\\nand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every\\nthing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on\\nto make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received\\nfrom Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,\\nif not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this\\neffect:\\n\\n\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\\n\\n\"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear\\nWickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so\\nrich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.\\nI am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not\\nthink we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.\\nAny place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,\\ndo not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\n\\n\"Yours, etc.\"\\n\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in\\nher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\\nSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\\nof what might be called economy in her own private expences, she\\nfrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\\ntheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\\nherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance\\ntowards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\\nrestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\\nextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap\\nsituation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for\\nher soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and\\nin spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\\nreputation which her marriage had given her.\\n\\nThough Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for\\nElizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was\\noccasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself\\nin London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently\\nstaid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he\\nproceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.\\n\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she\\nthought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\\ndropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\\nattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\\nto Elizabeth.\\n\\nPemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters\\nwas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\\nother even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\\nin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with\\nan astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of\\ntalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\\nwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\\npleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen\\nin her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that\\na woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not\\nalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\n\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;\\nand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in\\nher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him\\nlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\\nall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,\\nhe was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\\nand, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her\\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\\nto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait\\non them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\\nreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\\nvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\\n\\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.\\nDarcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever\\nsensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing\\nher into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 1342.txt or 1342.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/3/4/1342/\\n\\nProduced by Anonymous Volunteers\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\\npage at http://pglaf.org\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.","3":"austen","4":"pride"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}

## Preprocessing

### Tokenize the text


```r
text <- c("I <3 little pumpkins! OMG they're so cute.")


tokens(text, what = "sentence")
```

```
## Tokens consisting of 1 document.
## text1 :
## [1] "I <3 little pumpkins!" "OMG they're so cute."
```

```r
tokens(text, what = "character")
```

```
## Tokens consisting of 1 document.
## text1 :
##  [1] "I" "<" "3" "l" "i" "t" "t" "l" "e" "p" "u" "m"
## [ ... and 23 more ]
```

```r
text_token = tokens(text, what = "word") #default
text_token
```

```
## Tokens consisting of 1 document.
## text1 :
##  [1] "I"        "<"        "3"        "little"   "pumpkins" "!"       
##  [7] "OMG"      "they're"  "so"       "cute"     "."
```


### Remove punctuation, etc within tokens() function


```r
tokens(text,
remove_punct = TRUE,
remove_numbers = FALSE,
remove_symbols = TRUE)
```

```
## Tokens consisting of 1 document.

## [1] "I"        "3"        "little"   "pumpkins" "OMG"      "they're"  "so"      
## [8] "cute"
```


###  Make lower case


```r
# char_tolower(text) before tokenizing

tokens_tolower(text_token) #after tokenizing
```

```
## Tokens consisting of 1 document.
## text1 :
##  [1] "i"        "<"        "3"        "little"   "pumpkins" "!"       
##  [7] "omg"      "they're"  "so"       "cute"     "."
```


### You can also keep acronyms by adding: keep_acronyms = TRUE


```r
#char_tolower(text, keep_acronyms = TRUE) before tokenizing

tokens_tolower(text_token, keep_acronyms = TRUE)
```

```
## Tokens consisting of 1 document.
## text1 :
##  [1] "i"        "<"        "3"        "little"   "pumpkins" "!"       
##  [7] "OMG"      "they're"  "so"       "cute"     "."

dip_text = c("When I dip, he dips, we are dipping.")

dip_token = tokens(dip_text)

tokens_wordstem(dip_token)
```

```
## Tokens consisting of 1 document.
## text1 :
##  [1] "When" "I"    "dip"  ","    "he"   "dip"  ","    "we"   "are"  "dip" 
## [11] "."
```


## KeyWords in Context, a cool function


```r

Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
