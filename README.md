# Text analysis with quanteda


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Workshop contents

This workshop will introduce you to text analysis using the quanteda package. Text analysis is the process of automatically classifying and extracting meaningful information from unstructured text. Quanteda is  probably the most efficient tool to perform text analysis, as well as a variety of other natural language processing tasks such as corpus management, tokenization, and visualization.
