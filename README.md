This workshop will introduce you to text analysis using the quanteda package. Text analysis is the process of automatically classifying and extracting meaningful information from unstructured text. Quanteda is  a fundamental tool to perform text analysis, as well as a variety of other natural language processing tasks such as corpus management, tokenization, and visualization.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) introduce you to pre-processing of text and management of document-feature matrices, (2) try out basic functions on corpora and tokens, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
