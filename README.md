# Text analysis with quanteda


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Workshop contents

Please click [here](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop/14-FedericoMammana-Quanteda-/blob/main/Live%20Session%20Exercises.R) for the live session exercises. 

This workshop will introduce you to text analysis using the quanteda package. Text analysis is the process of automatically classifying and extracting meaningful information from unstructured text. Quanteda is  a fundamental tool to perform text analysis, as well as a variety of other natural language processing tasks such as corpus management, tokenization, and visualization.
The following poem will be used in the live tutorial:

"Ozymandias" by Percy Bysshe Shelley

I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said - “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert... Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) introduce you to pre-processing of text and management of document-feature matrices, (2) try out basic functions on corpora and tokens, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
